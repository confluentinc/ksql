# KSQL - Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka

> *Important: This release is a *developer preview* and is free and open-source from Confluent under the Apache 2.0 license. Do not run KSQL against a production cluster.*

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine that implements continuous, interactive queries against Apache Kafkaâ„¢. It allows you to query, read, write, and process data in Apache Kafka in real-time, at scale using SQL commands.

KSQL does not require proficiency with a programming language such as Java or Go, and it does not require you to install and manage a separate processing cluster technology. As such, it opens up the world of stream processing to a broader set of users and applications than ever before.

KSQL consists of a client and a server component.  The client is a command line interface (CLI) similar to the CLIs of MySQL or PostgreSQL. The server, of which you can run one or many instances, executes those queries for you.

# Quick Start
If you are ready to see the power of KSQL, try the [KSQL Quick Start](/docs/quickstart#quick-start)! The quick start configures a single instance in a lightweight Docker container or in a Kafka cluster. It demonstrates a simple workflow using KSQL to write streaming queries against data in Kafka.
