# KSQL - a Streaming SQL Engine for Apache Kafka<sup>TM</sup> from Confluent
---

A DEVELOPER PREVIEW

---

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine that implements continuous, interactive queries against Apache KafkaTM. It allows you to query, read, write, and process data in Apache Kafka in real-time, at scale using SQL commands. KSQL does not require proficiency with a programming language such as Java or Go, and it does not require you to install and manage a separate processing cluster technology. As such, it opens up the world of stream processing to a broader set of users and applications than ever before.

This release is a DEVELOPER PREVIEW which is free and open-source from Confluent under the Apache 2.0 license.

# Hello, KSQL!
---
Here are some example queries to illustrate the look and feel of the KSQL syntax:

Create a new stream that contains the pageviews from female users only
```sql
CREATE STREAM pageviews_by_female_users AS
  SELECT users.userid AS userid, pageid, regionid, gender FROM pageviews
  LEFT JOIN users ON pageview.userid = users.userid
  WHERE gender = 'FEMALE';
```

Continuously compute the number of pageviews for each page with 5-second tumbling windows
```sql
CREATE TABLE pageview_counts AS
  SELECT pageid, count(*) FROM pageviews
  WINDOW TUMBLING (size 5 second)
  GROUP BY pageid;
```

# How it works
---
KSQL consists of a client and a server component. The client is a command line interface (CLI) similar to the CLIs of MySQL or PostgreSQL. Use the CLI and client to enter your KSQL queries. The server, of which you can run one or many instances, executes those queries for you.

You can use KSQL in stand-alone mode and/or in client-server mode.

In stand-alone mode, both the KSQL client and server components are co-located on the same machine, in the same JVM, and are started together which makes it convenient for local development and testing.

In client-server mode, a pool of KSQL server(s) can be running on remote machines, VMs, or containers and the CLI connects to them over HTTP.

# Frequently Asked Questions
---
**Why would I choose KSQL over alternatives?**

KSQL allows you to query, read, write, and process data in Apache Kafka in real-time and at scale using intuitive SQL-like syntax. KSQL does not require proficiency with a programming language such as Java or Scala, and you don’t have to install a separate processing cluster technology.

**What are the technical requirements of KSQL?**

KSQL only requires 
1. a Java runtime environment
2. access to an Apache Kafka cluster on-premises or in the cloud for reading and writing data in real-time.

We recommend the use of [Confluent Platform](https://www.confluent.io/product/confluent-platform/) or [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) for running Apache Kafka.

**Is KSQL owned by the Apache Software Foundation?**

No, KSQL is owned and maintained by [Confluent Inc.](https://www.confluent.io/) as part of its free [Confluent Open Source](https://www.confluent.io/product/confluent-open-source/) product.

**How does KSQL compare to Apache Kafka’s Streams API?**

KSQL does not require proficiency with a programming language such as Java or Scala. It is aimed at users who are responding to a real-time, continuous business request, as opposed to writing a full-fledged stream processing application. That said, there are shades of grey here and experienced Kafka users will comprehend that for different purposes, one is better suited based on available developer talent, problem complexity and mission-criticality.

**Is KSQL ready for production?**

KSQL is a technical preview at this point in time.  We do not yet recommend to use it for production purposes.

**Can I use KSQL with my favorite data (e.g. JSON, Avro)?**

KSQL currently supports three formats: DELIMITED (CSV), JSON, and AVRO.

**Is KSQL fully compliant to ANSI SQL?**

KSQL is a dialect very similar to ANSI SQL but has a few differences because it is geared at processing streaming data. For example, ANSI SQL has no notion of “windowing” for use cases such as performing aggregations on data grouped into 5-minute windows, which is a commonly required functionality in the streaming world.
