# KSQL - The Streaming SQL Engine for Apache Kafka

*A Streaming SQL Engine for Apache Kafka from Confluent*

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine that implements continuous, interactive queries against Apache Kafkaâ„¢. It allows you to query, read, write, and process data in Apache Kafka in real-time, at scale using SQL commands. 

KSQL does not require proficiency with a programming language such as Java or Go, and it does not require you to install and manage a separate processing cluster technology. As such, it opens up the world of stream processing to a broader set of users and applications than ever before.

KSQL consists of a client and a server component.  The client is a command line interface (CLI) similar to the CLIs of MySQL or PostgreSQL. The server, of which you can run one or many instances, executes those queries for you.

> *Important: This release is a *developer preview* and is free and open-source from Confluent under the Apache 2.0 license.*

# Quick Start Guide
If you are ready to see the power of KSQL, try the [KSQL Quick Start](/docs/quickstart/)! The quick start configures a single instance in a lightweight Docker container or in a Kafka cluster. It demonstrates a simple workflow using KSQL to write streaming queries against data in Kafka.

# Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A Kafka cluster
- Java: Minimum version 1.7. 

1.  Clone the Confluent KSQL repository:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql
	```

1.  Navigate to the KSQL directory:

	```bash
	cd ksql
	```

1.  Compile the KSQL code:

	```bash
	mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
	```

1.  Start KSQL by running the compiled jar file ksql-cli/target/ksql-cli-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar. Use the local argument for the developer preview. This starts the KSQL engine locally.

	```bash
	./bin/ksql-cli local
	```

	When this command completes, you should see the KSQL prompt:

	```bash
	                       ======================================
