# ![KSQL rocket](ksq-lrocket.png) KSQL - Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka

> **KSQL is now GA and officially supported by Confluent Inc. [Get started with KSQL today](#getting-started).**

KSQL is the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka. It provides a simple and completely interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Kafka; no need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python. KSQL is distributed, scalable, reliable, and real-time. It supports a wide range of powerful stream processing operations including aggregations, joins, windowing, sessionization, and much more. You can find [more KSQL tutorials and resources here](https://confluent.io/ksql) if you are interested.

## Preview Releases

In addition to supported [stable KSQL releases](#stable-releases), we also provide preview releases.
We encourage you to try them in development and testing environments and to take advantage of
[Confluent Community resources](#community) to get help and share feedback.

# Documentation

See [KSQL documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/) for the latest stable release.


# Use Cases and Examples

## Streaming ETL

Apache Kafka is a popular choice for powering data pipelines.  KSQL makes it simple to transform data within the
pipeline, readying messages to cleanly land in another system.

```sql
CREATE STREAM vip_actions AS
  SELECT userid, page, action
  FROM clickstream c
  LEFT JOIN users u ON c.userid = u.user_id
  WHERE u.level = 'Platinum';
```


## Anomaly Detection

KSQL is a good fit for identifying patterns or anomalies on real-time data. By processing the stream as data arrives
you can identify and properly surface out of the ordinary events with millisecond latency.

```sql
CREATE TABLE possible_fraud AS
  SELECT card_number, count(*)
  FROM authorization_attempts
  WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 5 SECONDS)
  GROUP BY card_number
  HAVING count(*) > 3;
```


## Monitoring

Kafka's ability to provide scalable ordered messages with stream processing make it a common solution for log data
monitoring and alerting. KSQL lends a familiar syntax for tracking, understanding, and managing alerts.

```sql
CREATE TABLE error_counts AS
  SELECT error_code, count(*)
  FROM monitoring_stream
  WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 1 MINUTE)
  WHERE  type = 'ERROR'
  GROUP BY error_code;
```
