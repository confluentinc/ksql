      DO NOT USE THIS SUPPRESSION FILE
      If you really MUST suppress a rule, rather than just fixing / refactoring the code, then
      use inline code comments.

      There are two formats for the code comments:

      Turning off all rules CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, e.g.

      // CHECKSTYLE:OFF
      private void someBadFunction {
         // CHECKSTYLE:ON
          ... you code here.
      }

      Or turning off specific rules. Run names are separated by the pipe character '|'. e.g.

      // CHECKSTYLE_RULES.OFF: CyclomaticComplexity|JavaNCSS
      private void someBadFunction {
         // CHECKSTYLE_RULES.ON: CyclomaticComplexity|JavaNCSS
          ... you code here.
      }

      The reason code comments are preferred is that they work better with IDE plugins such as
      IDEA CheckStyle.
