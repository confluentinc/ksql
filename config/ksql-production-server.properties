#------ Endpoint config -------

### HTTP  ###
# The URL the KSQL server will listen on:
# The default is any IPv4 interface on the machine.
# NOTE: If set to wildcard or loopback set 'advertised.listener' to enable pull queries across machines
listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8088

# Use the 'listeners' line below for any IPv6 interface on the machine.
# listeners=http://[::]:8088

# If running a multi-node cluster across multiple machines and 'listeners' is set to a wildcard or loopback address
# 'advertised.listener' must be set to the URL other KSQL nodes should use to reach this node.
# advertised.listener=?

### HTTPS ###
# To switch KSQL over to communicating using HTTPS comment out the 'listeners' line above
# uncomment and complete the properties below.
# See: https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/operate-and-deploy/installation/server-config/security/#configure-the-cli-for-https
#
# listeners=https://0.0.0.0:8088
# advertised.listener=?
# ssl.keystore.location=?
# ssl.keystore.password=?
# ssl.key.password=?

#------ Logging config -------

# Automatically create the processing log topic if it does not already exist:
ksql.logging.processing.topic.auto.create=true

# Automatically create a stream within KSQL for the processing log:
ksql.logging.processing.stream.auto.create=true

# Uncomment the following if you wish the errors written to the processing log to include the
# contents of the row that caused the error.
# Note: care should be taken to restrict access to the processing topic if the data KSQL is
# processing contains sensitive information.
#ksql.logging.processing.rows.include=true

#------ External service config -------

# The set of Kafka brokers to bootstrap Kafka cluster information from:
bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092

# Enable snappy compression for the Kafka producers
compression.type=snappy

# uncomment the below to start an embedded Connect worker
# ksql.connect.worker.config=config/connect.properties
# ksql.connect.configs.topic=ksql-connect-configs

# Uncomment and complete the following to enable KSQL's integration to the Confluent Schema Registry:
#ksql.schema.registry.url=?


#------ Following configs improve performance and reliability of KSQL for critical/production setups. -------

# Also see: https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/installation/server-config/config-reference.html#recommended-ksql-production-settings

# Set the batch expiry to Integer.MAX_VALUE to ensure that queries will not
# terminate if the underlying Kafka cluster is unavailable for a period of
# time.
ksql.streams.producer.delivery.timeout.ms=2147483647

# Set the maximum allowable time for the producer to block to
# Long.MAX_VALUE. This allows KSQL to pause processing if the underlying
# Kafka cluster is unavailable.
ksql.streams.producer.max.block.ms=9223372036854775807

# For better fault tolerance and durability, set the replication factor and minimum insync replicas
# for the KSQL Server's internal topics.
# Note: the value 3 requires at least 3 brokers in your Kafka cluster.
ksql.internal.topic.replicas=3
ksql.internal.topic.min.insync.replicas=2

# Configure underlying Kafka Streams internal topics in order to achieve better fault tolerance and
# durability, even in the face of Kafka broker failures. Highly recommended for mission critical applications.
# Note that value 3 requires at least 3 brokers in your kafka cluster
# See https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#recommended-configuration-parameters-for-resiliency
ksql.streams.replication.factor=3
ksql.streams.producer.acks=all
ksql.streams.topic.min.insync.replicas=2

# Set the storage directory for stateful operations like aggregations and
# joins to be at a durable location. By default, they are stored in /tmp.
# Note that the path below needs to be replaced with the actual value
ksql.streams.state.dir=/some/non-temporary-storage-path/

# Bump the number of replicas for state storage for stateful operations
# like aggregations and joins. By having two replicas (one active and one
# standby) recovery from node failures is quicker since the state doesn't
# have to be rebuilt from scratch. This configuration is also essential for
# pull queries to be highly available during node failures
ksql.streams.num.standby.replicas=1
