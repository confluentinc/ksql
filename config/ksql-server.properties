### HTTP  ###
# The URL the KSQL server will listen on:
# The default is any IPv4 interface on the machine.
# NOTE: If set to wildcard or loopback set 'advertised.listener' to enable pull queries across machines
listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8088

# Use the 'listeners' line below for any IPv6 interface on the machine.
# listeners=http://[::]:8088

# If running a multi-node cluster across multiple machines and 'listeners' is set to a wildcard or loopback address
# 'advertised.listener' must be set to the URL other KSQL nodes should use to reach this node.
# advertised.listener=?

### HTTPS ###
# To switch KSQL over to communicating using HTTPS comment out the 'listeners' line above

# Uncomment the following if you wish the errors written to the processing log to include the
# contents of the row that caused the error.
