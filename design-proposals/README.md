# KSQL Improvement proposals

This is a place to collect improvement proposals for KSQL from the community. Please follow the [KLIP Template](klip-template.md) when creating a new KLIP.

Here is the process for submitting a KLIP and getting it approved.

1. Create a new branch off of master on your fork.
2. Copy the `klip-template.md` file and rename it with a klip number and title. For example `klip-0-add-protobuf-support.md`.
3. Fill in the details in KLIP file you created above.
4. Submit a PR from your branch to KSQL. Label it `design-proposal`, and share a link to the PR in the `#ksql` channel on the [confluent community slack](https://slackpass.io/confluentcommunity).
5. The design discussion will happen on the PR.
6. The KLIP is approved if at least two people with write access to the KSQL repo +1 the PR.
