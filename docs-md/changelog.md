KSQL Changelog
==============

Version 5.4.0
-------------

KSQL 5.4.0 includes new features, including:

-   UDAFs support STRUCTs as parameters and return values.
-   KSQL now supports working with source data where the value is an
    anonymous Avro or JSON serialized `ARRAY`, `MAP` or primitive type,
    for example `STRING` or `BIGINT`. Previously KSQL required all Avro
    values to be Avro records, and all JSON values to be JSON objects.
    For more information, see
    [Single field (un)wrapping](developer-guide/serialization.md#single-field-unwrapping).
-   KSQL now allows users to control how results containing only a
    single value field are serialized to Kafka. Users can now choose to
    serialize the single value as a named field within an outer Avro
    record or JSON object, depending on the format in use, or as an
    anonymous value. For more information, see
    [Single field (un)wrapping](developer-guide/serialization.md#single-field-unwrapping).
-   A new config `ksql.metrics.tags.custom` for adding custom tags to
    emitted JMX metrics. See [ksql.metrics.tags.custom](installation/server-config/config-reference.md#ksqlmetricstagscustom)
    for usage.
-   New `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` and `UNIX_DATE()` functions.
-   A new `KAFKA` format that supports `INT`, `BIGINT`, `DOUBLE` and
    `STRING` fields that have been serialized using the standard Kafka
    serializers, for example,
    `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongSerializer`.

    The format supports only single values, i.e. only single field,
    being primarily intended for use as a key format.

KSQL 5.4.0 includes the following miscellaneous changes:

-   Require either the value for a `@UdfParameter` or for the UDF JAR to
    be compiled with the Java8 `-parameters` compilation option. The UDF
    archetype now includes this flag.

Version 5.3.0
-------------

KSQL 5.3.0 includes new features, including:

-   Drop the requirement that `CREATE TABLE` statements must have a
    `KEY` set in their `WITH` clause. This is now an optional
    optimization to avoid unnecessary repartition steps. See [Github
    issue #2745](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/2745) for
    more info.
-   Improved handling of `KEY` fields. The `KEY` field is an optional
    copy of the Kafka record's key held within the record's value.
    Users can supply the name of the field that holds the copy of the
    key within the `WITH` clause. The improved handling may eliminate
    unnecessary repartition steps in certain queries. Note that
    preexisting persistent queries, like those created by using
    `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT ...` or `CREATE STREAM AS SELECT ...` or
    `INSERT INTO ...`, will continue to have the unnecessary repartition
    step. This is required to avoid the potential for data loss should
    this step be dropped. See [Github issue
    #2636](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/2636) for more
    info.
-   `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` is now supported, with standard SQL syntax
    to insert rows to existing KSQL streams/tables. To disable this
    functionality, set `ksql.insert.into.values.enabled` to `false` in
    the server properties.
-   `CREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE` will now allow you to create the
    topic if it is missing. To do this, specify the `PARTITIONS` and
    optionally `REPLICAS` in the `WITH` clause.
-   `CREATE STREAM AS SELECT ...` and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT ...`
    statements now use the source topic partitions and replica counts
    for the sink topic if the config properties are not set in the
    `WITH` clause. In case of JOIN, the left hand side topic is used.
    This deprecates `ksql.sink.partitions` and `ksql.sink.replicas`
    config properties.
-   A new config variable, `ksql.internal.topic.replicas`, was
    introduced to set the replica count for the internal topics created
    by KSQL Server. The internal topics include the command topic and
    the config topic.
-   A new KSQL testing tool was added. The tool is a command line
    utility that enables testing KSQL statements without requiring any
    infrastructure, like {{ site.ak }} and KSQL clusters.

KSQL 5.3.0 includes bug fixes, including:

-   The `ROWTIME` of the row generated when a `JOIN` encounters late
    data was previous the `ROWTIME` of the late event, where as now it
    is the max of `ROWTIME` of the rows involved in the join. This
    provides more deterministic join semantics.
-   Return values of UDF and UDAFs are now correctly marked as optional,
    where previously there was potential for non-optional fields, which
    would result in serialization issues in the presence of `null`
    values.

    This is a forward-compatible change in Avro, so after upgrading,
    KSQL is able to read old values using the new schema. However,
    it is important to ensure downstream consumers of the data are using
    the updated schema before upgrading KSQL, otherwise
    deserialization may fail. The updated schema is best obtained from
    running the query in another KSQL cluster, running version 5.3.

    See [Github issue
    #2769](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/2769) for more
    info.

-   Fixed issues with using `AS` keyword when aliasing sources. See
    [#2732](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/2732) for more
    info.

Version 5.2.0
-------------

KSQL 5.2 includes new features, including:

-   Support for [HTTPS](installation/server-config/security.md#configure-ksql-for-https).
-   Support for CASE expression: KSQL now supports CASE conditional
    expression in Searched form where KSQL evaluates each condition from
    left to right. It returns the result for the first condition that
    evaluates to `true`. If no condition evaluates to `true`, the result for
    the ELSE clause will be returned. If there is no ELSE clause, `null`
    is returned.
-   A new family of UDFs for improved handling of URIs (e.g. extracting
    information/decoding information), see
    [UDF table](developer-guide/syntax-reference.md#scalar-functions) for all URL functions
-   `LIMIT` keyword support for `PRINT`
    ([#1316](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/1316))
-   Support for read-after-write consistency: new commands don't
    execute until previous commands have finished executing. This
    feature is enabled by default in the CLI
    ([#2280](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/2280)) and can
    be implemented by the user for the REST API
    ([Coordinate Multiple Requests](developer-guide/api.md#coordinate-multiple-requests)).
-   A log of record processing events to help users debug their KSQL
    queries. The log can be configured to log to Kafka to be consumed as
    a KSQL stream. See
    [KSQL Processing Log](developer-guide/processing-log.md) for more
    details.
-   Aggregation functionality has been extended. KSQL now supports:
    -   `GROUP BY` more than just simple columns, including fields
        within structs, arithmetic results, functions, string
        concatenations and literals.
    -   literals in the projection, (a.k.a the `SELECT` clause).
    -   Multiple `HAVING` clauses, including the use of aggregate
        functions and literals.
-   Automatic compatibility management for queries in headless mode
    across versions. Starting with 5.2, KSQL will automatically take
    care of ensuring query compatibility when upgrading. This means you
    won't need to worry about setting properties correctly during
    upgrade, as has been required for previous upgrades. Refer to the
    [architecture documentation](concepts/ksql-architecture.md#config-topic)
    for details. Note that it is still up to the user to set properties
    correctly before upgrading to 5.2. The
    [upgrade doc](installation/upgrading.md) has details about the
    properties required to safely upgrade to 5.2.

KSQL 5.2 includes bug fixes, including:

-   Improved support for multi-line requests in interactive mode
    deployments. Prior to version 5.2 KSQL parsed the full request
    before attempting to execute any statements. Requests that contained
    later statements that were dependent the execution of prior
    statements may have failed. In version 5.2 and later, this is no
    longer an issue.
-   Improved support for non-interactive, "headless" mode deployments.
    Prior to version 5.2 KSQL parsed the full script before attempting
    to execute any statements. The full parse would often fail when
    later statements relied on the execution of earlier statements. In
    version 5.2 and later, this is no longer an issue.

KSQL 5.2 deprecates some features, including:

-   The use of the `RUN SCRIPT` statement via the REST API is now
    deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. ([Github
    issue #2179](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/2179)). The
    feature circumnavigates certain correctness checks and is
    unnecessary, given the script content can be supplied in the main
    body of the request. If you are using the `RUN SCRIPT` functionality
    from the KSQL CLI you will not be affected, as this will continue to
    be supported. If you are using the `RUN SCRIPT` functionality
    directly against the REST API your requests will work with the 5.2
    server, but will be rejected after the next major version release.
    Instead, include the contents of the script in the main body of your
    request.

Version 5.1.0
-------------

KSQL 5.1 includes new features, including:

-   `WindowStart()` and `WindowEnd()` UDFs
-   `StringToDate()` and `DateToString()` UDFs
