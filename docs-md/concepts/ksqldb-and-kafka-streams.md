ksqlDB is the streaming database for {{ site.aktm }}. With ksqlDB, you can
write event streaming applications by using a lightweight SQL syntax.

{{ site.kstreams }} is the {{ site.ak }} library for writing streaming
applications and microservices in Java and Scala.

ksqlDB is built on {{ site.kstreams }}, a robust stream processing framework
that is part of {{ site.ak }}.

![The Confluent Platform stack, with ksqlDB built on Kafka Streams](../img/ksqldb-kafka-streams-core-kafka-stack.png)

ksqlDB gives you a query layer for building event streaming applications on
{{ site.ak }} topics. ksqlDB abstracts away much of the complex programming
that's required for real-time operations on streams of data, so that one line
of SQL can do the work of a dozen lines of Java or Scala.

For example, to implement simple fraud-detection logic on a {{ site.ak }} topic
named `payments`, you could write one line of SQL:

```sql
CREATE STREAM fraudulent_payments AS
 SELECT fraudProbability(data) FROM payments
 WHERE fraudProbability(data) > 0.8
 EMIT CHANGES;
```

The equivalent Scala code on {{ site.kstreams }} might resemble:

```scala
// Example fraud-detection logic using the Kafka Streams API.
object FraudFilteringApplication extends App {

  val builder: StreamsBuilder = new StreamsBuilder()
  val fraudulentPayments: KStream[String, Payment] = builder
    .stream[String, Payment]("payments-kafka-topic")
    .filter((_ ,payment) => payment.fraudProbability > 0.8)
  fraudulentPayments.to("fraudulent-payments-topic")

  val config = new java.util.Properties 
  config.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "fraud-filtering-app")
  config.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "kafka-broker1:9092")

  val streams: KafkaStreams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), config)
  streams.start()
}
```

ksqlDB is easier to use, and {{ site.kstreams }} is more flexible. Which
technology you choose for your real-time streaming applications depends
on a number of considerations. Keep in mind that you can use both ksqlDB
and {{ site.kstreams }} together in your implementations.

Differences Between ksqlDB and Kafka Streams
--------------------------------------------

The following table summarizes some of the differences between ksqlDB and
{{ site.kstreams }}.

Developer Workflows
-------------------

There are different workflows for ksqlDB and {{ site.kstreams }} when you
develop streaming applications.

- ksqlDB: You write SQL queries interactively and view the results in
real-time, either in the ksqlDB CLI or in {{ site.c3 }}.
- {{ site.kstreams }}: You write code in Java or Scala, recompile, and run
and test the application in an IDE, like IntelliJ. You deploy the
application to production as a jar file that runs in a {{ site.ak }} cluster.

Usually, ksqlDB isn't a good fit for BI reports, ad-hoc querying, or
queries with random access patterns, because it's a continuous query
system on data streams.
