Materialized Views
==================

API Reference
-------------

- [CREATE STREAM AS SELECT](../developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/create-stream-as-select.md)
- [CREATE TABLE AS SELECT](../developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/create-table-as-select.md)

Materialized views are derived representations of streams or tables.
They effectively allow you to create new collections over existing ones.
Materialized views are perpetually kept up to date in real-time as new
events arrive through the collections they are built over. This means that
you can chain materialized views together to create many representations
of the same data. Materialized views are especially useful for maintaining
aggregated tables of data.
