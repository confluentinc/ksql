ksqlDB has a rich set of constructs for both storing events in collections and
deriving new ones through stream processing. Sometimes, you need to process
your events by aggregating them together into a materialized view. In this
case, you need a way for your applications or microservices to leverage this
view. That's where queries come in.

Push and pull queries
---------------------

Queries enable you to ask questions about materialized views. ksqlDB supports
two different kinds of client-issued queries: push and pull.

- [Push Queries](push.md) enable you to subscribe to a result as it changes in
  real-time.
- [Pull Queries](pull.md) enable you to look up information at a point in time.
 
ksqlDB supports both kinds of queries by using SQL over its REST API. Combining
them enables you to build powerful real-time applications.
