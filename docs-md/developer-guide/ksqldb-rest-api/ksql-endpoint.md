title: Run a ksqlDB Statement
tagline: ksql endpoint
description: Use the `/ksql` resource to run a sequence of ksqlDB statements
keywords: ksqldb
---

The `/ksql` resource runs a sequence of SQL statements. All statements,
except those starting with SELECT, can be run on this endpoint. To run
SELECT statements use the `/query` endpoint.

!!! note
      If you use the SET or UNSET statements to assign query properties by
      using the REST API, the assignment is scoped only to the current
      request. In contrast, SET and UNSET assignments in the ksqlDB CLI persist
      throughout the CLI session.

POST /ksql

:   Run a sequence of SQL statements.

JSON Parameters:

- **ksql** (string): A semicolon-delimited sequence of SQL statements to run.
- **streamsProperties** (map): Property overrides to run the statements with.
  Refer to the :ref:`Config Reference <ksql-param-reference>` for details on
  properties that can be set.
- **streamsProperties[``property-name``]** (string): The value of the property
- named by ``property-name``. Both the value and ``property-name`` should be
  strings.
- **commandSequenceNumber** (long): Optional. If specified, the statements will
  not be run until all existing commands up to and including the specified
  sequence number have completed. If unspecified, the statements are run
  immediately. When a command is processed, the result object contains its
  sequence number.

The response JSON is an array of result objects. The result object contents
depend on the statement that it is returning results for. The following
sections detail the contents of the result objects by statement.

**Errors**

If ksqlDB fails to execute a statement, it returns a response with an error
status code (4xx/5xx). Even if an error is returned, the server may have been
able to successfully execute some statements in the request. In this case, the
response includes the ``error_code`` and ``message`` fields, a ``statementText``
field with the text of the failed statement, and an ``entities`` field that
contains an array of result objects:

Response JSON Object:

- **statementText** (string): The text of the SQL statement where the error occurred.
- **entities** (array): Result objects for statements that were successfully executed by the server.

The ``/ksql`` endpoint may return the following error codes in the ``error_code`` field:

- 40001 (BAD_STATEMENT): The request contained an invalid SQL statement.
- 40002 (QUERY_ENDPOINT): The request contained a statement that should be issued to the ``/query`` endpoint.

**Example request**

```http
POST /ksql HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

{
  "ksql": "CREATE STREAM pageviews_home AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE pageid='home'; CREATE STREAM pageviews_alice AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE userid='alice';",
  "streamsProperties": {
    "ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset": "earliest"
  }
}
```

**Example response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

[
  {
    "statementText":"CREATE STREAM pageviews_home AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE pageid='home';",
    "commandId":"stream/PAGEVIEWS_HOME/create",
    "commandStatus": {
      "status":"SUCCESS",
      "message":"Stream created and running"
    },
    "commandSequenceNumber":10
  },
  {
    "statementText":"CREATE STREAM pageviews_alice AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE userid='alice';",
    "commandId":"stream/PAGEVIEWS_ALICE/create",
    "commandStatus": {
      "status":"SUCCESS",
      "message":"Stream created and running"
    },
    "commandSequenceNumber":11
  }
]
```

Coordinate Multiple Requests
----------------------------

To submit multiple, interdependent requests, there are two options. The
first is to submit them as a single request, similar to the example
request above:

```http
POST /ksql HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

{
  "ksql": "CREATE STREAM pageviews_home AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE pageid='home'; CREATE TABLE pageviews_home_count AS SELECT userid, COUNT(*) FROM pageviews_home GROUP BY userid EMIT CHANGES;"
}
```

The second method is to submit the statements as separate requests and
incorporate the interdependency by using `commandSequenceNumber`. Send
the first request:

```http
POST /ksql HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

{
  "ksql": "CREATE STREAM pageviews_home AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE pageid='home' EMIT CHANGES;"
}
```

Make note of the `commandSequenceNumber` returned in the response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

[
  {
    "statementText":"CREATE STREAM pageviews_home AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE pageid='home' EMIT CHANGES;",
    "commandId":"stream/PAGEVIEWS_HOME/create",
    "commandStatus": {
      "status":"SUCCESS",
      "message":"Stream created and running"
    },
    "commandSequenceNumber":10
  }
]
```

Provide this `commandSequenceNumber` as part of the second request,
indicating that this request should not execute until after command
number 10 has finished executing:

```http
POST /ksql HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

{
  "ksql": "CREATE TABLE pageviews_home_count AS SELECT userid, COUNT(*) FROM pageviews_home GROUP BY userid EMIT CHANGES;",
  "commandSequenceNumber":10
}
```
