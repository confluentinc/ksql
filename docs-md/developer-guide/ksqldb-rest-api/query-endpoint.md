The `/query` resource lets you stream the output records of a `SELECT`
statement via a chunked transfer encoding. The response is streamed back
until the `LIMIT` specified in the statement is reached, or the client
closes the connection. If no `LIMIT` is specified in the statement, then
the response is streamed until the client closes the connection.

POST /query

:   Run a ``SELECT`` statement and stream back the results.

JSON Parameters:

- **ksql** (string): The SELECT statement to run.
- **streamsProperties** (map): Property overrides to run the statements with. Refer to the :ref:`Config Reference <ksql-param-reference>` for details on properties that can be set.
- **streamsProperties**[``property-name``] (string): The value of the property named by ``property-name``. Both the value and ``property-name`` should be strings.

Each response chunk is a JSON object with the following format:

Response JSON Object:

- **row** (object): A single row being returned. This will be null if an error is being returned.
- **row.columns** (array): The values contained in the row.
- **row.columns[i]** (?): The value contained in a single column for the row. The value type depends on the type of the column.
- **finalMessage** (string): If this field is non-null, it contains a final message from the server. No additional rows will be returned and the server will end the response.
- **errorMessage** (string): If this field is non-null, an error has been encountered while running the statement. No additional rows are returned and the server will end the response.
