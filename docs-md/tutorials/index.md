ksqlDB Basics
-------------

This tutorial demonstrates a simple workflow using ksqlDB to write
streaming queries against messages in {{ site.aktm }}.

### Write Streaming Queries with the ksqlDB CLI

![image](../img/ksql-interface-create-stream.png){width="600px"}

Get started with ksqlDB and {{ site.c3 }}:

-   {{ site.c3short }}
    [deployed with Docker](https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/ce-docker-quickstart.html)
-   {{ site.c3short }}
    [deployed locally](https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/ce-quickstart.html)

Stream Processing Cookbook
--------------------------

The [Stream Processing Cookbook](https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/stream-processing-cookbook)
contains ksqlDB recipes that provide in-depth tutorials and recommended
deployment scenarios.

Clickstream Data Analysis Pipeline
----------------------------------

Clickstream analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, and
reporting aggregate data about which pages a website visitor visits and
in what order. The path the visitor takes though a website is called the
clickstream.

This tutorial focuses on building real-time analytics of users to
determine:

-   General website analytics, such as hit count and visitors
-   Bandwidth use
-   Mapping user-IP addresses to actual users and their location
-   Detection of high-bandwidth user sessions
-   Error-code occurrence and enrichment
-   Sessionization to track user-sessions and understand behavior (such
    as per-user-session-bandwidth, per-user-session-hits etc)

The tutorial uses standard streaming functions (i.e., min, max, etc) and
enrichment using child tables, stream-table join, and different types of
windowing functionality.

Get started now with these instructions:

-   [Clickstream Data Analysis Pipeline Using KSQL (Docker)](clickstream-docker.md)

If you don't have Docker, you can also run an
[automated version](https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/tree/master/clickstream)
of the Clickstream tutorial designed for local {{ site.cp }}
installs. Running the Clickstream demo locally without Docker requires
that you have {{ site.cp }} installed locally, along with
Elasticsearch and Grafana.

ksqlDB Examples
---------------

[These examples](examples.md) provide common ksqlDB usage operations.

You can configure Java streams applications to deserialize and ingest
data in multiple ways, including {{ site.ak }} console producers, JDBC
source connectors, and Java client producers. For full code examples,

ksqlDB in a Kafka Streaming ETL
-------------------------------

To learn how to deploy a Kafka streaming ETL using ksqlDB for stream
processing, you can run the
[Confluent Platform demo](https://docs.confluent.io/current/tutorials/cp-demo/docs/index.html).
All components in the {{ site.cp }} demo have encryption,
authentication, and authorization configured end-to-end.
