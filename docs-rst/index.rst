   <h2>What Is KSQL?</h2>

---------------------

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine for Apache KafkaÂ®. It provides a simple interactive SQL interface for stream
processing on Kafka, without the need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python. KSQL is scalable, reliable,
and real-time. It supports a wide range of streaming operations, including aggregations, joins, windowing, and sessionization.

   <h2>What Can I Do With KSQL?</h2>

---------------------

Streaming ETL
    Apache Kafka is a popular choice for powering data pipelines. KSQL makes it simple to transform data within the pipeline, readying messages to cleanly land in another system.

Real-time Monitoring and Analytics
    Track, understand, and manage infrastructure, applications, and data feeds by quickly building real-time dashboards, generating metrics, and creating custom alerts and messages.

Data exploration and discovery
    Navigate and browse through your data in Kafka.

Anomaly detection
    Identify patterns and spot anomalies in real-time data with millisecond latency, allowing you to properly surface out of the ordinary events and to handle fraudulent activities separately.

Personalization
    Create data driven real-time experiences and insight for users.

Sensor data and IoT
    Understand and deliver sensor data how and where it needs to be.

Customer 360-view
    Achieve a comprehensive understanding of your customers across every interaction through a variety of channels, where new information is continuously incorporated in real-time.

   <h2>What Are the Components?</h2>

---------------------

KSQL Server
    The KSQL server runs the engine that executes KSQL queries. This includes processing, reading, and writing data to and from
    the target Kafka cluster.

    Servers can run in containers, virtual machines, and bare-metal machines. You can add or remove multiple servers in the
    same resource pool to elastically scale query processing in or out. You can use different resource pools to achieve workload
    isolation.

CLI
    You can interactively write KSQL queries by using the KSQL command line interface (CLI). The KSQL CLI acts as a client
    to the KSQL server.
