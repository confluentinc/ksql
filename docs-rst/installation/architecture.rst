KSQL Architecture
-----------------

KSQL is an abstraction of Kafka Streams API.

KSQL processes streams of data that are stored in Kafka topics. KSQL data can be structured as Avro, JSON, DELIMITED (CSV).

There are KSQL servers, which form KSQL server pools, and there is a CLI client that connect to the KSQL clusters.
