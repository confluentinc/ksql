# KSQL Documentation

## Overview

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine that implements continuous, interactive queries against Apache Kafka™. It allows you to query, read, write, and process data in Apache Kafka in real-time, at scale using SQL an SQL-like commands. KSQL interacts directly with the [Kafka Streams API](http://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/concepts.html), removing the requirement of building a Java app. Common KSQL use cases are:

- Fraud detection - identify and act on out of the ordinary data to provide real-time awareness. 
- Personalization - create real-time experiences and insight for end users driven by data. 
- Notifications - build custom alerts and messages based on real-time data. 
- Real-time Analytics - power real-time dashboards to understand what’s happening as it does. 
- Sensor data and IoT - understand and deliver sensor data how and where it needs to be. 
- Customer 360 - provide a clear, real-time understanding of your customers across every interaction.

KSQL lowers the barriers for using real-time data in your applications. It is powered by a scalable streaming platform without the learning curve or additional management complexity of other stream processing solutions.

## Features

## Concepts
KSQL queries are issued from the KSQL CLI client and operated on a server. The CLI executes the continuous query by converting it into a Kafka Streams DSL and runs it.

## Getting Started
<!-- What do you users need to get started -->

* Beginners can try the [interactive quickstart](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql).
* Advanced users can try a more realistic [end-to-end KSQL demo](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql).

To learn more about KSQL see our [documentation](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql) including the [KSQL Syntax Guide](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql).
