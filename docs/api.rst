KSQL REST API Reference
=======================

Content Types
-------------

The KSQL REST API uses content types for requests and responses to indicate the serialization format of the data and the API version. Currently, the only serialization format supported is JSON. The only version supported is v1. Your request should specify this serialization format and version in the ``Accept`` header as::

    Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

The less specific ``application/json`` content type is also permitted. However, this is only for compatibility and ease of use, and you should use the versioned value if possible.

The server also supports content negotiation, so you may include multiple, weighted preferences::

    Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json; q=0.9, application/json; q=0.5

For example, content negotiation is useful when a new version of the API is preferred, but you are not sure if it is available yet.

Errors
------

All API endpoints use a standard error message format for any requests that return an HTTP status indicating an error (any 4xx or 5xx statuses):

.. code:: http

   HTTP/1.1 <Error Status>
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error_code": <Error code>
       "message": <Error Message>
   }

Some endpoints may include additional fields that provide more context for handling the error.

Run a KSQL Statement
--------------------

The KSQL resource runs a sequence of KSQL statements. All statements, except those starting with ``SELECT``, can be run on this endpoint. To run ``SELECT`` statements use the ``/query`` endpoint.

.. http:post:: /ksql

   Run a sequence of KSQL statements.

   :json string ksql: A semicolon-delimited sequence of KSQL statements to run.
   :json map streamsProperties: Property overrides to run the statements with. Refer to the :ref:`Config Reference <ksql-param-reference>` for details on properties that can be set.
   :json string streamsProperties[``property-name``]: The value of the property named by ``property-name``. Both the value and ``property-name`` should be strings.

   The response JSON is an array of result objects. The result object contents depend on the statement that it is returning results for. The following sections detail the contents of the result objects by statement.

   **CREATE, DROP, TERMINATE**

   :>json string statementText: The KSQL statement whose result is being returned.
   :>json string commandId: A string that identifies the requested operation. You can use this ID to poll the result of the operation using the status endpoint.

   :>json map    overriddenProperties: The property overrides that the query is running with. 

   **Errors**

   If KSQL fails to execute a statement, it returns a response with an error status code (4xx/5xx). Even if an error is returned, the server may have been able to successfully execute some statements in the request. In this case, the response includes the ``error_code`` and ``message`` fields, 
a ``statementText`` field with the text of the failed statement, and an ``entities`` field that contains an array of result objects:

   :>json string statementText: The text of the KSQL statement where the error occurred.
   :>json array  entities: Result objects for statements that were successfully executed by the server.

   The ``/ksql`` endpoint may return the following error codes in the ``error_code`` field:

   - 40001 (BAD_STATEMENT): The request contained an invalid KSQL statement.
   - 40002 (QUERY_ENDPOINT): The request contained a statement that should be issued to the ``/query`` endpoint.

   **Example request**

   .. code:: http

      POST /ksql HTTP/1.1
      Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
      Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

      {
        "ksql": "CREATE STREAM pageviews_home AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE pageid='home'; CREATE STREAM pageviews_alice AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE userid='alice'",
        "streamsProperties": {
          "ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset": "earliest"
        }
      }

   **Example response**

   .. code:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

      [
        {
          "statementText":"CREATE STREAM pageviews_home AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE pageid='home';",
          "commandId":"stream/PAGEVIEWS_HOME/create",
          "commandStatus": {
            "status":"SUCCESS",
            "message":"Stream created and running"
          }
        },
        {
          "statementText":"CREATE STREAM pageviews_alice AS SELECT * FROM pageviews_original WHERE userid='alice';",
          "commandId":"stream/PAGEVIEWS_ALICE/create",
          "commandStatus": {
            "status":"SUCCESS",
            "message":"Stream created and running"
          }
        }
      ]

Run A Query And Stream Back The Output
--------------------------------------

The query resource lets you stream the output records of a ``SELECT`` statement via a chunked transfer encoding. The response is streamed back until the ``LIMIT`` specified in the statement is reached, or the client closes the connection. If no ``LIMIT`` is specified in the statement, then the response is streamed until the client closes the connection.

.. http:post:: /query

   Run a ``SELECT`` statement and stream back the results.

   :json string ksql: The SELECT statement to run.
   :json map streamsProperties: Property overrides to run the statements with. Refer to the :ref:`Config Reference <ksql-param-reference>` for details on properties that can be set.
   :json string streamsProperties[``property-name``]: The value of the property named by ``property-name``. Both the value and ``property-name`` should be strings.

   Each response chunk is a JSON object with the following format:

   :>json object row: A single row being returned. This will be null if an error is being returned.
   :>json array  row.columns: The values contained in the row.
   :>json ?      row.columns[i]: The value contained in a single column for the row. The value type depends on the type of the column.
   :>json string errorMessage: If this field is non-null, an error has been encountered while running the statement. No additional rows are returned and the server will end the response. Note that when the limit is reached for a query that specified a limit in the LIMIT clause, the server returns a row with error message "LIMIT reached for the partition."


   **Example request**

   .. code:: http

      POST /query HTTP/1.1
      Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
      Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

      {
        "ksql": "SELECT * FROM pageviews;"
        "streamsProperties": {
          "ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset": "earliest"
        }
      }

   **Example response**

   .. code:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
      Transfer-Encoding: chunked

      ...
      {"row":{"columns":[1524760769983,"1",1524760769747,"alice","home"]},"errorMessage":null}
      ...

Get the Status of a CREATE, DROP, or TERMINATE
----------------------------------------------

CREATE, DROP, and TERMINATE statements returns an object that indicates the current state of statement execution. A statement can be in one of the following states:

- QUEUED, PARSING, EXECUTING: The statement was accepted by the server and is being processed.
- SUCCESS: The statement was successfully processed.
- ERROR: There was an error processing the statement. The statement was not executed.
- TERMINATED: The query started by the statement was terminated. Only returned for ``CREATE STREAM|TABLE AS SELECT``.

If a CREATE, DROP, or TERMINATE statement returns a command status with state QUEUED, PARSING, or EXECUTING from the ``/ksql`` endpoint, you can use the ``/status`` endpoint to poll the status of the command.

.. http:get:: /status/(string:commandId)

   Get the current command status for a CREATE, DROP, or TERMINATE statement.

   :param string commandId: The command ID of the statement. This ID is returned by the /ksql endpoint.

   :>json string status: One of QUEUED, PARSING, EXECUTING, TERMINATED, SUCCESS, or ERROR.
   :>json string message: Detailed message regarding the status of the execution statement.

   **Example request**

   .. code:: http

      GET /status/stream/PAGEVIEWS/create HTTP/1.1
      Accept: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json
      Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

   **Example response**

   .. code:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type application/vnd.ksql.v1+json

      {
        "status": "SUCCESS",
        "message":"Stream created and running"
      }
