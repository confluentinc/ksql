# Components
The main components of KSQL are the KSQL CLI and the KSQL server.

#### KSQL CLI
The KSQL CLI allows you to interactively write KSQL queries.
Its interface should be familiar to users of MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, Hive, Presto, etc.

The KSQL CLI acts as a client to the KSQL server (see next section).

#### KSQL Server
The KSQL server runs the engine that executes KSQL queries, which includes the data processing as well as reading
data from and writing data to the target Kafka cluster.

# Terminology
When using KSQL, the following terminology is used.

#### Stream

A stream is an unbounded sequence of structured data ("facts").  For example, we could have a stream of financial transactions such as "Alice sent $100 to Bob, then Charlie sent $50 to Bob".  Facts in a stream are immutable, which means new facts can be inserted to a stream, but existing facts can never be updated or deleted.  Streams can be created from a Kafka topic or derived from existing streams and tables.  In both cases, a stream's underlying data is durably stored (persisted) within a Kafka topic on the Kafka brokers.

#### Table

A table is a view of a stream, or another table, and represents a collection of evolving facts.  For example, we could have a table that contains the latest financial information such as "Bobâ€™s current account balance is $150".  It is the equivalent of a traditional database table but enriched by streaming semantics such as windowing.  Facts in a table are mutable, which means new facts can be inserted to the table, and existing facts can be updated or deleted.  Tables can be created from a Kafka topic or derived from existing streams and tables.  In both cases, a table's underlying data is
durably stored (persisted) within a Kafka topic on the Kafka brokers.

# Modes of operation

## Standalone mode

In stand-alone mode, both the KSQL client and server components are co-located on the same machine, in the same JVM,
and are started together.  This makes standalone mode very convenient for local development and testing.

![Standalone mode](/docs/img/standalone-mode.png)

To run KSQL in standalone mode:

- Start the KSQL CLI and the server components all in the same JVM:
    -  Start with default settings:

        ```bash
        $ ./bin/ksql-cli local
        ```

    -  Start with [custom settings](/docs/syntax-reference.md#configuring-ksql), pointing KSQL at a specific
       Kafka cluster (see Kafka's [bootstrap.servers](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#newconsumerconfigs)
       setting):

        ```bash
        $ ./bin/ksql-cli local --bootstrap-server kafka-broker-1:9092 \
                               --properties-file path/to/ksql-cli.properties
        ```


## Client-server mode

In client-server mode, you can run a pool of KSQL servers on remote machines, VMs, or containers.
The CLI then connects to these remote KSQL servers over HTTP.

![Client-server mode](/docs/img/client-server.png)

To run KSQL in client-server mode:

- Start any number of server nodes:
    -  Start with default settings:

        ```bash
        $ ./bin/ksql-server-start
        ```

    -  Start with [custom settings](/docs/syntax-reference.md#configuring-ksql), pointing KSQL at a specific
       Kafka cluster (see Kafka's [bootstrap.servers](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#newconsumerconfigs)
       setting):

        ```bash
        $ hostname
        my-ksql-server

        $ cat ksql-server.properties
        # You must set at least the following two properties
        bootstrap.servers=kafka-broker-1:9092
        # Note: `application.id` is not really needed but you must set it
        #       because of a known issue in the KSQL Developer Preview
        application.id=app-id-setting-is-ignored

        # Optional settings below, only for illustration purposes
        # The hostname/port on which the server node will listen for client connections
        listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8090
        ```

        To start the server node with the settings above:

        ```bash
        $ ./bin/ksql-server-start ksql-server.properties
        ```
- Start any number of CLIs, specifying the desired KSQL server address as the `remote` endpoint:

  ```bash
  $ ./bin/ksql-cli remote http://my-ksql-server:8090
  ```

All KSQL servers (and their engines) share the work of processing KSQL queries that are submitted to them:
- To add processing capacity, start more KSQL servers (scale out).  You can do this during live operations.
- To remove processing capacity, stop some of the running KSQL servers.  You can do this during live operations.
  The remaining KSQL servers will automatically take over the processing work of the stopped servers.  Make sure
  that at least one KSQL server is running, otherwise your queries will not be executed any longer.

<!--
## Application mode
In application mode, you can put your KSQL queries in a file and share across your Kafka Streams instances.

![Application mode](/docs/img/application-mode.png)

Here's an overview of running KSQL in application mode:

- Start an engine instance and pass a file of KSQL statements to run, for example:

  ```bash
  $ ./bin/ksql-node --query-file=path/to/queries.sql
  ```
  or

  ```bash
  $ ./bin/ksql-node --properties-file ksql.properties --query-file=path/to/queries.sql
  ```
- This mode is ideal for streaming-ETL application deployment, for example, you can version-control your queries as code.
- All engines share the work, for example, instances of the same KSQL app. You can scale up or down without restarting.
 
## Embedded mode
In embedded mode, you can write KSQL code inside of your streams Java app, using the KSQL context object inside of your application. The KSQL code will run inside the individual application instances. For more information, see [this example](/ksql-examples/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/embedded/EmbeddedKsql.java).
