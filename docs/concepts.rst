==========
Components
==========

The main components of KSQL are the KSQL CLI and the KSQL server.

KSQL CLI
--------

The KSQL CLI allows you to interactively write KSQL queries. Its
interface should be familiar to users of MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, Hive,
Presto, etc.

The KSQL CLI acts as a client to the KSQL server.

KSQL Server
-----------

The KSQL server runs the engine that executes KSQL queries, which
includes the data processing as well as reading data from and writing
data to the target Kafka cluster.

Servers can run in containers, virtual machines, and bare-metal machines. You can add or remove multiple servers in the
same resource pool to elastically scale query processing in or out. You can use different resource pools to achieve
workload isolation.

===========
Terminology
===========

When using KSQL, the following terminology is used.

Stream
------

A stream is an unbounded sequence of structured data (“facts”). For
example, we could have a stream of financial transactions such as “Alice
sent $100 to Bob, then Charlie sent $50 to Bob”. Facts in a stream are
immutable, which means new facts can be inserted to a stream, but
existing facts can never be updated or deleted. Streams can be created
from a Kafka topic or derived from an existing table. A stream’s underlying data is durably stored (persisted) within a
Kafka topic on the Kafka brokers.

Table
-----

A table is a view of a stream, or another table, and represents a
collection of evolving facts. For example, we could have a table that
contains the latest financial information such as “Bob’s current account
balance is $150”. It is the equivalent of a traditional database table
but enriched by streaming semantics such as windowing. Facts in a table
are mutable, which means new facts can be inserted to the table, and
existing facts can be updated or deleted. Tables can be created from a
Kafka topic or derived from existing streams and tables. In both cases,
a table’s underlying data is durably stored (persisted) within a Kafka
topic on the Kafka brokers.

.. _modes-of-operation:

==================
Modes of operation
==================

Standalone mode
---------------

In standalone mode, both the KSQL client and server components are
co-located on the same machine, in the same JVM, and are started
together. This makes standalone mode very convenient for local
development and testing.

To run KSQL in standalone mode:

-  Start the KSQL CLI and the server components all in the same JVM:

   -  Start with default settings:

      .. code:: bash

		$ ./bin/ksql-cli local

   -  Start with :ref:`custom
      settings <configuring-ksql>`, pointing
      KSQL at a specific Kafka cluster (see the Streams
      `bootstrap.servers <streams_developer-guide_required-configs>`
      setting):

      .. code:: bash

		$ ./bin/ksql-cli local --bootstrap-server kafka-broker-1:9092 \
                       --properties-file path/to/ksql-cli.properties

Client-server mode
------------------

In client-server mode, the KSQL servers are run separately from the KSQL CLI client. You can deploy servers on remote machines,
VMs, or containers and then the CLI connects to these remote servers.

You can add or remove servers from the same resource pool during live operations, to elastically scale query processing. You
can use different resource pools to achieve workload isolation. For example, you can deploy separate pools for production
and for testing.

To run KSQL in client-server mode:

-  Start any number of server nodes:

   -  Start with default settings:

      .. code:: bash

		$ ./bin/ksql-server-start

   -  Start with :ref:`custom
      settings <configuring-ksql>`, pointing
      KSQL at a specific Kafka cluster (see Streams :ref:`bootstrap servers <streams_developer-guide_required-configs>` setting):

      .. code:: bash

         $ hostname
         my-ksql-server

         $ cat ksql-server.properties
         # You must set at least the following two properties
         bootstrap.servers=kafka-broker-1:9092
         # Note: `application.id` is not really needed but you must set it
         #       because of a known issue in the KSQL Developer Preview
         application.id=app-id-setting-is-ignored
         
         # Optional settings below, only for illustration purposes
         # The hostname/port on which the server node will listen for client connections
         listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8090

      To start the server node with the settings above:

      .. code:: bash

		$ ./bin/ksql-server-start ksql-server.properties

-  Start any number of CLIs, specifying the desired KSQL server address
   as the ``remote`` endpoint:

   .. code:: bash

       $ ./bin/ksql-cli remote http://my-ksql-server:8090

KSQL servers that share the same ``command`` topic belong to the same resource pool. By default, a KSQL server uses the
``ksql__commands`` command topic. To assign a server to a different pool, change the ``ksql.command.topic.suffix`` setting in its configuration:

.. code:: bash

    # Default value: `commands`.
    #
    # Changing this to `production_commands` as shown below will result in
    # the command topic named `ksql__production_commands` being used.
    ksql.command.topic.suffix = production_commands
