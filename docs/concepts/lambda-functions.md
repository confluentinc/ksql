# Lambda Functions

Lambda functions enable users to express simple inline functions that can be applied to input values in various ways. 
For example, lambda functions could be applied to each element of a collection, resulting in a transformed output collection. 
Lambda functions could also be used to filter the elements of a collection, or reduce a collection down to a single value.
This allows users to express user-defined functionality in a way that doesnâ€™t require them to implement full-fledged UDFs.

Learn how to use lambda functions in the [how-to guide](/how-to-guides/use-lambda-functions-in-udfs).
