For detailed descriptions of ksqlDB SQL statements and keywords, see the 
[ksqlDB API reference](../../ksqldb-reference).

For details on SQL syntax, see [ksqlDB syntax reference](../../syntax-reference).


## ADVANCE BY
Specify the duration of a "hop" in a HOPPING window. For more information,
see [Time and Windows in ksqlDB](../../../concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries).

```sql
SELECT [...], aggregate_function
  WINDOW HOPPING (SIZE <time_span> <time_units>, ADVANCE BY <time_span> <time_units>) [...]
```

## ALTER SYSTEM
Change a system-level property value (only available in {{ site.ccloud }}).


```sql
ALTER SYSTEM 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';
```

## ALTER STREAM
Add new columns to a stream. This is not supported for streams defined using queries
(`CREATE STREAM ... AS`).

```sql
ALTER STREAM stream_name
  ADD [COLUMN] column_name data_type
  ADD [COLUMN] ... ...
  ...
```

## ALTER TABLE
Add new columns to a table. This is not supported for tables defined using queries
(`CREATE TABLE ... AS`)
```sql
ALTER TABLE stream_name
  ADD [COLUMN] column_name data_type
  ADD [COLUMN] ... ...
  ...
```

## AND / OR
Logical AND/OR operators in a WHERE clause. For more information, see
[SELECT](/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/select-push-query/#examples).

```sql hl_lines="4"
SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM stream_name | table_name
  WHERE condition          
    AND|OR condition
```

## AS
Alias a column, expression, or type. For more information, see
[Create a table](/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/create-table-as-select/#examples).

```sql hl_lines="1"
SELECT column_name AS column_alias
  FROM stream_name | table_name
```

## ASSERT
Assert values, stream, table, or tombstones.

```sql
ASSERT NULL VALUES sourceName (columns)? KEY values            
```

## ASSERT SCHEMA
Assert the existence or non-existence of a schema.

```sql
ASSERT (NOT EXISTS)? SCHEMA (SUBJECT subjectName)? (ID id)? (TIMEOUT timeout)?;     
```

## ASSERT TOPIC
Assert the existence or non-existence of a topic.

```sql
ASSERT (NOT EXISTS)? TOPIC topicName (WITH properties)? (TIMEOUT timeout)?;         
```

## BETWEEN
Constrain a value to a specified range in a WHERE clause.

```sql
WHERE expression [NOT] BETWEEN start_expression AND end_expression;            
```

The BETWEEN operator is used to indicate that a certain value must be
within a specified range, including boundaries. ksqlDB supports any
expression that resolves to a numeric or string value for comparison.

The following push query uses the BETWEEN clause to select only records
that have an `event_id` between 10 and 20.

```sql
SELECT event
  FROM events
  WHERE event_id BETWEEN 10 AND 20
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

## CASE
Select a condition from one or more expressions.

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN condition THEN result
    [ WHEN … THEN … ]
    …
    [ WHEN … THEN … ]
    [ ELSE result ]
  END
FROM stream_name | table_name;
```

ksqlDB supports a `searched` form of CASE expression. In this form, CASE
evaluates each boolean `condition` in WHEN clauses, from left to right.
If a condition is true, CASE returns the corresponding result. If none of
the conditions is true, CASE returns the result from the ELSE clause. If
none of the conditions is true and there is no ELSE clause, CASE returns null.

The schema for all results must be the same, otherwise ksqlDB rejects the
statement.

The following example push query uses a CASE expression.

```sql
SELECT
 CASE
   WHEN orderunits < 2.0 THEN 'small'
   WHEN orderunits < 4.0 THEN 'medium'
   ELSE 'large'
 END AS case_result
FROM orders
EMIT CHANGES;
```

## CAST
Change the type of an expression to a different type.

```sql
CAST (expression AS data_type);
```

You can cast an expression's type to a new type by using CAST.

The following example query converts a numerical count, which is a BIGINT, into
a suffixed string, which is a VARCHAR. For example, the integer `5` becomes
`5_HELLO`.

```sql
SELECT page_id, CONCAT(CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR), '_HELLO')
  FROM pageviews_enriched
  WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 20 SECONDS)
  GROUP BY page_id;
```

## CREATE CONNECTOR

information, see [CREATE CONNECTOR](../../ksqldb-reference/create-connector).

```sql
CREATE SOURCE | SINK CONNECTOR connector_name
  WITH( property_name = expression [, ...]);

must group by the keys that are selected in the query. For more information,
see [Time and Windows in ksqlDB](../../../concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries#windows-in-sql-queries).

```sql hl_lines="4"

```

## HAVING

## HOPPING

DROP TABLE  [IF EXISTS] table_name  [DELETE TOPIC];
```

## IN

```sql hl_lines="3"
  SELECT select_expr [, ...]
    FROM from_stream | from_table
    WHERE exp IN (exp0, exp1, exp2);
```

The above is equivalent to:

```sql hl_lines="3"

    WHERE exp = exp0 OR exp = exp1 OR exp = exp2;
```

## INNER JOIN

      JOIN [join_table | join_stream]
        [WITHIN [<size> <timeunit> | (<before_size> <timeunit>, <after_size> <timeunit>)] [GRACE PERIOD <grace_size> <timeunit>]]
      ON join_criteria
  [ WHERE condition ]
  [ PARTITION BY new_key_expr [, ...] ]
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

## INSERT VALUES

SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM stream_name1 | table_name1

## LIKE
Match a string with the specified pattern.

```sql hl_lines="3"
  SELECT select_expr [, ...]

```

The LIKE operator is used for prefix or suffix matching. ksqlDB supports
the `%` wildcard, which represents zero or more characters.

The following push query uses the `%` wildcard to match any `user_id` that
starts with "santa".

```sql
SELECT user_id
