SELECT (Push Query)
===================

Synopsis
--------

```sql
SELECT select_expr [, ...]
  FROM from_item
  [ LEFT JOIN join_table ON join_criteria ]
  [ WINDOW window_expression ]
  [ WHERE condition ]
  [ GROUP BY grouping_expression ]
  [ HAVING having_expression ]
  EMIT [ output_refinement ]
  [ LIMIT count ];
```

Description
-----------

Push a continuous stream of updates to the ksqlDB stream or table. The result of
this statement isn't persisted in a Kafka topic and is printed out only in
the console, or returned to the client. To stop a push query started in the CLI press Ctrl+C.

Execute a push query via the CLI or by sending an HTTP request to the ksqlDB REST API, and
the API sends back a chunked response of indefinite length.

Push queries enable you to subscribe to changes, which enable
reacting to new information in real-time. Theyâ€™re a good fit for asynchronous
application flows. For request/response flows, see [Pull Queries](select-pull-query.md).

Push queries can use all available SQL features, which can be useful when prototyping a
persistent query or when running ad-hoc queries from the CLI. But unlike persistent queries,

push queries are not shared. If multiple clients submit the same push query, ksqlDB computes

independent results for each client.

!!! tip
    If you're using push queries from an application, move all the heavy lifting into a persistent
    query and keep your push query as simple as possible.

In the previous statements, `from_item` is one of the following:

-   `stream_name [ alias ]`
-   `table_name [ alias ]`
-   `from_item LEFT JOIN from_item ON join_condition`

The WHERE clause can refer to any column defined for a stream or table,
including the `ROWTIME` pseudo column.

Example
-------

The following statement shows how to select all records from a `pageviews`
stream that have timestamps between two values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pageviews
  WHERE ROWTIME >= 1510923225000
    AND ROWTIME <= 1510923228000
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

When writing logical expressions using `ROWTIME`, you can use ISO-8601
formatted date strings to represent date times. For example, the previous
query is equivalent to the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pageviews
  WHERE ROWTIME >= '2017-11-17T04:53:45'
    AND ROWTIME <= '2017-11-17T04:53:48'
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

If the datestring is inexact, the rest of the timestamp is assumed to be
padded with 0s. For example, `ROWTIME = '2019-07-30T11:00'` is
equivalent to `ROWTIME = '2019-07-30T11:00:00.0000'`.

You can specify time zones within the datestring. For example,
`2017-11-17T04:53:45-0330` is in the Newfoundland time zone. If no
timezone is specified within the datestring, then timestamps are
interpreted in the UTC time zone.

You use the `LIMIT` clause to limit the number of rows returned. Once the
limit is reached, the query terminates.

The following statement shows how to select five records from a `pageviews`
stream.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM pageviews EMIT CHANGES LIMIT 5;
```

If no limit is supplied the query runs until terminated, streaming
back all results to the console.

!!! tip
      If you want to select older data, you can configure ksqlDB to
      query the stream from the beginning. You must run this configuration
      before running the query:

```sql
SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
```

#### WINDOW

!!! note
    You can use the WINDOW clause only if the `from_item` is a stream.

The WINDOW clause lets you control how to group input records *that have
the same key* into so-called *windows* for operations like aggregations
or joins. Windows are tracked per record key. For more information, see 
[Time and Windows in ksqlDB](../../concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries.md).

Windowing adds two additional system columns to the data, which provide
the window bounds: `WINDOWSTART` and `WINDOWEND`.

ksqlDB supports the following WINDOW types.

#### TUMBLING window

Tumbling windows group input records into fixed-sized,
non-overlapping windows based on the records' timestamps. You must
specify the *window size* for tumbling windows. Tumbling windows are a
special case of hopping windows, where the window size is equal to the
advance interval.

The following statement shows how to create a push query that has a tumbling
window.

```sql
SELECT windowstart, windowend, item_id, SUM(quantity)
  FROM orders
  WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 20 SECONDS)
  GROUP BY item_id
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

#### HOPPING window

Hopping windows group input records into fixed-sized,
(possibly) overlapping windows based on the records' timestamps. You
must specify the *window size* and the *advance interval* for
hopping windows.

The following statement shows how to create a push query that has a hopping
window.

```sql
SELECT windowstart, windowend, item_id, SUM(quantity)
  FROM orders
  WINDOW HOPPING (SIZE 20 SECONDS, ADVANCE BY 5 SECONDS)
  GROUP BY item_id
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

#### SESSION window

Session windows group input records into so-called
sessions. You must specify the *session inactivity gap* parameter
for session windows. For example, imagine you set the inactivity gap
to 5 minutes. If, for a given record key such as "alice", no new
input data arrives for more than 5 minutes, then the current session
for "alice" is closed, and any newly arriving data for "alice" in
the future will mark the beginning of a new session.

The following statement shows how to create a push query that has a session
window.

```sql
SELECT windowstart, windowend, item_id, SUM(quantity)
  FROM orders
  WINDOW SESSION (20 SECONDS)
  GROUP BY item_id
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

#### Late arriving events

Accept events for up to two hours after the window ends. Events that arrive
later than the grace period are dropped and not included in the aggregate
result.

```sql
SELECT orderzip_code, TOPK(order_total, 5) FROM orders
  WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 1 HOUR, GRACE PERIOD 2 HOURS) 
  GROUP BY order_zipcode
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

#### EMIT

The EMIT clause lets you control the output refinement of your push query. The output refinement is
how you would like to *emit* your results. 

ksqlDB supports the following output refinement types.

#### CHANGES

This is the standard output refinement for push queries, for when we would like to see all changes 
happening.

#### FINAL

This is for when we want to emit only the final result of a windowed aggregation, and suppress the 
intermediate results until the window closes. Note that this output refinement is supported only 
for windowed aggregations.
