CREATE, DROP, and TERMINATE statements return an object that indicates
the current state of statement execution. A statement can be in one of
the following states:

-   QUEUED, PARSING, EXECUTING: The statement was accepted by the server
    and is being processed.
-   SUCCESS: The statement was successfully processed.
-   ERROR: There was an error processing the statement. The statement
    was not executed.
-   TERMINATED: The query started by the statement was terminated. Only
    returned for `CREATE STREAM|TABLE AS SELECT`.

If a CREATE, DROP, or TERMINATE statement returns a command status with
state QUEUED, PARSING, or EXECUTING from the `/ksql` endpoint, you can
use the `/status` endpoint to poll the status of the command.
