KSQL Serialization
==================

=========================
Controlling serialization
=========================

KSQL offers several mechanisms for controlling serialization and deserialization.

The primary mechanism is by choosing the serialization format when you create
a stream or table and specify the ``VALUE_FORMAT`` in the ``WITH`` clause.

.. code:: sql

    CREATE TABLE x (F0 INT, F1 STRING) WITH (VALUE_FORMAT='JSON', ...);

For more information on the formats that KSQL supports, see :ref:`ksql_formats`.

KSQL provides some additional configuration that allows serialization to be controlled:

.. _ksql_formats:

=======
Formats
=======

KSQL currently supports three serialization formats:

*. ``DELIMITED`` supports comma separated values. See :ref:`delimited_format` below.
*. ``JSON`` supports JSON values. See :ref:`json_format` below.
*. ``AVRO`` supports AVRO serialized values. See :ref:`avro_format` below.

.. _delimited_format:

---------
DELIMITED
---------

The ``DELIMITED`` format supports comma separated values.

The serialized object should be a Kafka-serialized string, which will be split into columns.

For example, given a KSQL statement such as:

.. code:: sql

    CREATE STREAM x (ID BIGINT, NAME STRING, AGE INT) WITH (VALUE_FORMAT='DELIMITED', ...);

KSQL splits a value of ``120, bob, 49`` into the three fields with ``ID`` of ``120``,
``NAME`` of ``bob`` and ``AGE`` of ``49``.

This data format supports all KSQL :ref:`data types <data-types>` except ``ARRAY``, ``MAP`` and
``STRUCT``.

.. _json_format:

----
JSON
----

The ``JSON`` format supports JSON values.

The JSON format supports all of KSQL's ref:`data types <data-types>`. As JSON does not itself
support a map type, KSQL serializes ``MAP``s as JSON objects.  Because of this the JSON format can
only support ``MAP`` objects that have ``STRING`` keys.

The serialized object should be a Kafka-serialized string containing a valid JSON value. The format
supports JSON objects only. Top-level primitives, arrays and maps are not currently supported.

JSON Objects
------------

Values that are JSON objects are probably the most common.

For example, given a KSQL statement such as:

.. code:: sql

    CREATE STREAM x (ID BIGINT, NAME STRING, AGE INT) WITH (VALUE_FORMAT='JSON', ...);

And a JSON value of:

.. code:: json

       {
         "id": 120,
         "name": "bob",
         "age": "49"
       }

KSQL deserializes the JSON object's fields into the corresponding fields of the stream.

.. _avro_format:

----
Avro
----

The ``AVRO`` format supports Avro binary serialization of all of KSQL's ref:`data types <data-types>`.

The format supports Avro records only. Top-level primitives, arrays and maps are not supported at
this time.

The format requires KSQL to be configured to store and retrieve the Avro schemas from the |sr-long|.
For more information, see :ref:`install_ksql-avro-schema`.

------------
Avro Records
------------

Avro records can be deserialized into matching KSQL schemas.

For example, given a KSQL statement such as:

.. code:: sql

    CREATE STREAM x (ID BIGINT, NAME STRING, AGE INT) WITH (VALUE_FORMAT='JSON', ...);

And an Avro record serialized with the schema:

.. code:: json

       {
         "type": "record",
         "namespace": "com.acme",
         "name": "UserDetails",
         "fields": [
           { "name": "id", "type": "long" },
           { "name": "name", "type": "string" }
           { "name": "age", "type": "int" }
         ]
       }

KSQL deserializes the Avro record's fields into the corresponding fields of the stream.
