Here are some example queries to illustrate the look and feel of the KSQL syntax.

### Filter an inbound stream of page views to only show errors

```sql
SELECT STREAM request, ip, status 
 WHERE status >= 400
```

###Create a new stream that contains the pageviews from female users only

```sql
CREATE STREAM pageviews_by_female_users AS
  SELECT users.userid AS userid, pageid, regionid, gender FROM pageviews
  LEFT JOIN users ON pageview.userid = users.userid
  WHERE gender = 'FEMALE';
```

### Continuously compute the number of pageviews for each page with 5-second tumbling windows

```sql
CREATE TABLE pageview_counts AS
  SELECT pageid, count(*) FROM pageviews
  WINDOW TUMBLING (size 5 second)
  GROUP BY pageid;
```
