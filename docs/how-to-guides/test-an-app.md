# How to test an application

## Context

You have an application of ksqlDB statements, and you want to automatically test whether they behavior correctly when given a set of inputs. ksqlDB exposes a *test runner* command line tool to do just that. It runs quickly and doesn't require a running {{ site.aktm }} or ksqlDB cluster.

## In action

```bash
ksql-test-runner -s statements.sql -i input.json -o output.json
```

## Usage

To test a set of SQL statements, you provide three files, one file
containing the SQL statements and two JSON files containing the input
records and the expected output records.

```
NAME
        ksql-test-runner - The KSQL testing tool

SYNOPSIS
        ksql-test-runner {--input-file | -i} <inputFile>
                {--output-file | -o} <outputFile>
                {--sql-file | -s} <statementsFile>

OPTIONS
        --input-file <inputFile>, -i <inputFile>
            A JSON file containing the input records.

            This option may occur a maximum of 1 time


        --output-file <outputFile>, -o <outputFile>
            A JSON file containing the expected output records.

            This option may occur a maximum of 1 time


        --sql-file <statementsFile>, -s <statementsFile>
            A SQL file containing KSQL statements to be tested.

            This option may occur a maximum of 1 time
```

## Test file structure

### Statements File

The statements file contains the SQL statements to test. The following
are the supported statements in the testing tool:

- `CREATE STREAM`
- `CREATE TABLE`
- `CREATE STREAM AS SELECT`
- `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`
- `INSERT INTO`

Here is a sample statements file for the testing tool:

```sql
CREATE STREAM orders (ORDERID INT KEY, ORDERUNITS double) WITH (kafka_topic='test_topic', value_format='JSON');
CREATE STREAM S1 AS SELECT ORDERID, ORDERUNITS, CASE WHEN orderunits < 2.0 THEN 'small' WHEN orderunits < 4.0 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'large' END AS case_result FROM orders EMIT CHANGES;
```

### Input File

The input file is a JSON file with one array field named `inputs`.
Each element in the array is the representation of input messages.

The input messages array can't be empty. A message should have a topic, a
key, a value, and a timestamp. The following is a sample input file for
the previous test:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {"topic": "test_topic", "timestamp": 0, "key": 0, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 2.0}},
    {"topic": "test_topic", "timestamp": 0, "key": 100, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 4.0}},
    {"topic": "test_topic", "timestamp": 0, "key": 101, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 6.0 }},
    {"topic": "test_topic", "timestamp": 0, "key": 101, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 3.0}},
    {"topic": "test_topic", "timestamp": 0, "key": 101, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 1.0}}
  ]
}
```

### Output File

The output file is a JSON file with an array field named `outputs`.
Similar to the input file, each element in the array is the
representation of the expected output messages.

The output messages array can't be empty. An expected output message should
have a topic, a key, a value, and a timestamp. The following is a sample
expected output file for the previous test:

```json
{
  "outputs": [
    {"topic": "S1", "timestamp": 0, "key": 0, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 2.0, "CASE_RESULT": "medium"}},
    {"topic": "S1", "timestamp": 0, "key": 100, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 4.0, "CASE_RESULT": "large"}},
    {"topic": "S1", "timestamp": 0, "key": 101, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 6.0, "CASE_RESULT": "large"}},
    {"topic": "S1", "timestamp": 0, "key": 101, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 3.0, "CASE_RESULT": "medium"}},
    {"topic": "S1", "timestamp": 0, "key": 101, "value": {"ORDERUNITS": 1.0, "CASE_RESULT": "small"}}
  ]
}
```

In the input and output files you can have messages with windowed keys.
Such messages can be generated by windowed aggregations in ksqlDB. To
specify a window for a message you can add a `window` field to the
message. A window field has three fields:

-   **start:** the start time for the window.
-   **end:** the end time for the window.
-   **type:** the type of the window. A window type can be `time` or
    `session`.

The following is an example expected output file with records that have
a window field:

```json
{
   "outputs": [
     {"topic": "S2", "timestamp": 0, "key": 0, "window": {"start": 0, "end": 30000, "type": "time"}, "value": "0,0"},
     {"topic": "S2", "timestamp": 10000, "key": 0, "window": {"start": 0, "end": 30000, "type": "time"}, "value": "0,5"},
     {"topic": "S2", "timestamp": 30000, "key": 100, "window": {"start": 30000, "end": 60000, "type": "time"}, "value": "100,100"},
     {"topic": "S2", "timestamp": 45000, "key": 100, "window": {"start": 30000, "end": 60000, "type": "time"}, "value": "100,100"}
   ]
}
```

Currently, in the input files you can have only records with session
window types.

### Running the testing tool

The testing tool indicates the success or failure of a test by
printing the corresponding message. The following is the result of a
successful test:

```bash
ksql-test-runner -s statements.sql -i input.json -o output.json
```

Your output should resemble:

```
>>> Test passed!
```

Note that the tool may also write verbose log output to the terminal too, in 
which case you may need to page through it to locate the test status message.

If a test fails, the testing tool will indicate the failure along with
the cause. Here is an example of the output for a failing test:

```
  >>>>> Test failed: Topic 'S1', message 4: Expected <101, {"ORDERUNITS":18.0,"CASE_RESULT":"small"}> with timestamp=0 but was <101, {ORDERUNITS=1.0, CASE_RESULT=small}> with timestamp=0
```

## Query execution

To use the ksqlDB testing tool effectively, you need to understand the
query execution logic in the testing tool. Although the final results
should be deterministic, the intermediate results in SQL queries
({{ site.ak }} Apps) may vary based on several factors, such as order of
reading input or config properties like the producer buffer size. In
order to make the composition of output for the test cases simpler, the
ksqlDB testing tool executes queries in a predictable way. Consider the
following guidance when you prepare the output for your tests.

### Input consumption

Before processing the next input message, the testing tool processes
input messages for each query one-by-one and writes the generated
message(s) for each input message into the result topic. This means that
queries running in the testing tool have the same behavior as when
`cache.max.bytes.buffering = 0`. This is especially important in
aggregate queries, where you may not see some of the intermediate results
in real executions because of buffering, but when the testing tool executes,
every possible intermediate result is created.

### Kafka cluster

The ksqlDB testing tool doesn't use a real Kafka cluster. Instead, it simulates
the behavior of a cluster with a single broker for the SQL queries. This
means that the testing tool ignores configuration settings for the input
and output topics, like the number of partitions or replicas.

### Processing order

The testing tool processes the statements in the order that you provide
them. So, for a given statement, only the statements before it can
potentially affect its results. This behavior differs from a ksqlDB
cluster, where statements that are submitted later can affect the output
of a query. For example, consider the following set of statements:

```sql
CREATE STREAM orders (ORDERUNITS double) WITH (kafka_topic='test_topic', value_format='JSON');
INSERT INTO orders VALUES(10.0);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES(15.0);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES(20.0);
CREATE STREAM S1 AS SELECT ORDERUNITS, CASE WHEN orderunits < 2.0 THEN 'small' WHEN orderunits < 4.0 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'large' END AS case_result FROM orders EMIT CHANGES;
INSERT INTO orders VALUES(25.0);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES(30.0);
```

If you run these statements in a real ksqlDB cluster, you see one
result generated for each `INSERT INTO` statement, and you have five
messages in the output. On the other hand, if you run the previous
statements in the testing tool, only the `INSERT INTO` statements before
the CSAS query generate results, and the testing tool doesn't run the
query for the messages generated by the `INSERT INTO` statements after the
CSAS statement.

Note: Be aware of the the order in which the input data for a query is
processed. For a given query, the testing tool first processes the input
messages provided in the input file. After fully processing these messages,
the testing tool inspects the source topics for the query in the simulated
Kafka cluster and processes any messages in these topics. For `JOIN` queries
that have more than one source topic, the testing tool first processes the
left-side topic and then processes the right-side topic.
