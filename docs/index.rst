.. important::

    This release is a developer preview. It is strongly recommended that you test before running KSQL against a production Kafka cluster.

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafkaâ„¢. It provides a simple interactive SQL interface for stream
processing on Kafka, without the need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python. KSQL is scalable, reliable,
and real-time. It supports a wide range of streaming operations, including aggregations, joins, windowing, and sessionization.

---------
Use cases
---------

Common KSQL use cases are:

-  Streaming ETL:  Apache Kafka is a popular choice for powering data pipelines. KSQL makes it simple to transform data within the pipeline, readying messages to cleanly land in another system.
- Real-time Monitoring and Analytics: track, understand, and manage infrastructure, applications, and data feeds by quickly building real-time dashboards, generating metrics, and creating custom alerts and messages.
- Data exploration and discovery: navigate and browse through your data in Kafka.
- Anomaly detection: identify patterns and spot anomalies in real-time data with millisecond latency, allowing you to properly surface out of the ordinary events and to handle fraudulent activities separately.
- Personalization: create data driven real-time experiences and insight for users.
- Sensor data and IoT: understand and deliver sensor data how and where it needs to be.
- Customer 360-view: achieve a comprehensive understanding of your customers across every interaction through a variety of channels, where new information is continuously incorporated in real-time.
