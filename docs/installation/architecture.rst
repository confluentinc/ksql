KSQL Architecture
-----------------

KSQL is an abstraction of Kafka Streams API.

KSQL consumes streams of data that are stored in Kafka topics. KSQL data can be structured as Avro, JSON, DELIMITED (CSV).

There are KSQL servers, which form KSQL clusters, and there is a CLI client that connect to the KSQL clusters.
