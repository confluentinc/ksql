# Monitoring

## Context

ksqlDB publishes metrics via JMX ([Java Management
Extensions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html))
which help you monitor what is happening inside of ksqlDB's servers. For a
comprehensive list of metrics, see [the reference section](../reference/metrics.md).

## Enable monitoring

You must enable monitoring explicitly on each ksqlDB server. To enable
it in a Docker-based deployment, export an environment variable named
`KSQL_JMX_OPTS` with your JMX configuration and expose the port that
JMX will communicate over.

The following Docker Compose example shows how you can configure
monitoring for ksqlDB server. The surrounding components, like the
broker and CLI, are omitted for brevity. You can see an example of a
complete setup in the [quickstart](https://ksqldb.io/quickstart.html).

```yaml
ksqldb-server:
  image: confluentinc/ksqldb-server:{{ site.ksqldbversion }}
  hostname: ksqldb-server
  container_name: ksqldb-server
  depends_on:
    - broker
    - schema-registry
  ports:
    - "8088:8088"
    - "1099:1099"
  environment:
    KSQL_LISTENERS: "http://0.0.0.0:8088"
    KSQL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: "broker:9092"
    KSQL_KSQL_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL: "http://schema-registry:8081"
    KSQL_KSQL_LOGGING_PROCESSING_STREAM_AUTO_CREATE: "true"
    KSQL_KSQL_LOGGING_PROCESSING_TOPIC_AUTO_CREATE: "true"
    KSQL_KSQL_QUERY_PULL_METRICS_ENABLED: "true"
    KSQL_JMX_OPTS: >
      -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=1099
```

With respect to monitoring, here it what this does:

- The environment variable `KSQL_JMX_OPTS` is supplied to the server
  with various arguments. The `>` character lets you write a
  multi-line string in Yaml, which makes this long argument easier to
  read. The advertised hostname, port, and security settings are
  configured. JMX has a wide range of [configuration
  options](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html),
  and you can set these however you like.

- Port `1099` is exposed, which corresponds to the JMX port set in the
  `KSQL_JMX_OPTS` configuration. This enables remote monitoring tools
  to communicate into ksqlDB's process.

## Verifying your monitoring setup

An easy way to check that ksqlDB is properly emitting metrics is by
using `jconsole`. JConsole is a graphical monitoring tool to monitor
the JVM, and it ships with by default with Oracle JDK installations.

On your host machine, run the command:

```bash
jconsole
```

You will be prompted for a host and port. If you used the example
configuration, `localhost:1099` establishes the connection. You
should see a series of graphs showing resource utilization. If you
don't, make sure the networking between your machine and the Docker
container is configured correctly.
