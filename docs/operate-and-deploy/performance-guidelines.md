One of the principal benefits of using ksqlDB for stream processing is that it
enables you to define your workload declaratively. All ksqlDB stream processing
logic is defined using SQL statements, which are internally transformed into
execution plans that perform the necessary computations as efficiently as
possible.

Abstracting away internal execution plans underneath a SQL layer enables rapid
development of stream processing workloads, but when you want optimal
performance, you need to know something about the internal system behavior
of ksqlDB.

This document provides an overview of key factors affecting ksqlDB performance,
so you can develop high-performance stream processing workloads using ksqlDB.
A basic understanding of ksqlDB's key abstractions is assumed, so if you're new
to ksqlDB, read through the [core concepts](index.md) documentation before
proceeding.

These guidelines are recommendations for getting the best performance from your
ksqlDB workload. For example, if your workload is unable to keep up with the
rate at which your input data is being produced, these guidelines may help to
increase your workload's throughput to keep it from falling behind.

## Persistent queries

Typically, a ksqlDB workload is composed of one or more persistent queries.
These queries consume input continuously from {{ site.aktm }} topics and produce
their output back into {{ site.ak }} topics. Although this document describes
how to define these persistent queries such that they are as efficient as
possible, the number of persistent queries running on a ksqlDB deployment has
system-wide performance implications, regardless of how simple or complex they
may be.

### Combine persistent queries

Combine as much work as possible into as few persistent queries as possible.
Each individual persistent query within a ksqlDB workload incurs a significant
amount of system resource overhead. As a result, you should structure your
workload such that all required work is consolidated into as few persistent
queries as possible. A workload consolidated into a single persistent query
requires significantly less system-resource overhead as the same workload
spread across two persistent queries.

Minimizing the number of persistent queries that your workload uses is probably
the single most impactful design pattern that you can leverage, so it's a
recurring theme throughout this performance guide. You'll learn more about the
specific benefits of running fewer persistent queries in the following sections.

## State stores

[ksqlDB workloads](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-materialized-views-work-with-ksqldb/)
consume their input from {{ site.ak }} topics and produce their output into
{{ site.ak }} topics, but some local state is also maintained on each ksqlDB node.
This state effectively serves as a local cache of topic data that improves workload
performance. Local ksqlDB state is managed by using a pluggable key-value storage
interface. RocksDB is the default storage engine for local state.

In addition to being stored as local key-value stores, each ksqlDB state store
is also backed by a changelog topic in {{ site.ak }}. Storing a complete log of
all changes made to each local state store enables ksqlDB to recover in the
event of a node failure.

### Minimize the size of your state stores

State store sizes are proportional to the size of each key-value record that
they contain. Smaller state stores reduce the amount of disk read-and-write
throughput performed by ksqlDB, resulting in better overall workload throughput.
Also, smaller state stores minimize local and {{ site.ak }} disk storage
consumption. State store row sizes may be minimized by eliminating unused
fields in your events.

### Reduce the number of state stores

Minimize the number of state stores that your ksqlDB deployment uses. ksqlDB
batches writes made to local state stores, so fewer state stores enables larger
batches of writes to a given state store, which improves disk write throughput.
Having fewer state stores minimizes both local and {{ site.ak }} disk storage
requirements.

## Serialization and deserialization

Input and output events consumed and produced by ksqlDB workloads are
serialized as {{ site.ak }} messages, so each consumed event must be
deserialized before being processed by ksqlDB. Similarly, each output event
produced by ksqlDB must be serialized before being written to {{ site.ak }}.
As a result, event serialization is generally the most expensive aspect of
any ksqlDB workload.

!!! important

    You should use the format that best suits your use case, but keep in mind
    that event serialization is usually the dominant cost for most workloads. 

### Avoid unnecessary serialization and deserialization

Avoid extraneous serialization and deserialization operations. Combine as much
work as possible into as few persistent queries as your use case allows. For
example, instead of performing a transformation with one persistent query and
filtering its output with another persistent query, consider combining the
transformation and filter into a single persistent query. In this case,
serialization and deserialization overhead would be reduced approximately by
half.

### Reduce event complexity and size

Avoid unnecessary event complexity and size. Smaller, simpler events are more
efficient to serialize and deserialize. If your workload doesn't require
certain fields in your input messages, consider removing these fields as early
as possible to improve serialization performance. In some cases, it may be
preferable to use ksqlDB itself to perform this message simplification by
selecting a subset of the messages' fields to prepare them for downstream
processing.

## Transformations and filters

A transformation is any reference to a column that is not a bare column
reference. For example, a function call over a column, and an arithmetic
expression involving one or more columns are both transformations. A filter
is a Boolean expression invoked via a WHERE clause that excludes any events
for which that expression evaluates to false. Transformations and filters
are thus evaluated for each input event, and typically incur a negligible
amount of performance overhead. This does not necessarily apply to
[user-defined function](/how-to-guides/create-a-user-defined-function)
invocations.

### Consolidate transformations and filters

Consolidate your transformations and filters into as few persistent queries as
possible. Although transformations and filters generally aren't performance
bottlenecks, each individual persistent query does incur a significant amount
of system-resource overhead. For this reason, you should combine as many of
your transformations and filters as possible into the fewest number of
persistent queries that your workload allows. Additionally, for any
transformations that reduce event size, we recommend that you perform these
transformations as early as possible in your processing pipeline.

## Topic repartitioning

ksqlDB relies heavily on topic partitioning to spread work across a deployment.
For aggregations and joins, it's especially important to understand partitioning
semantics.

For aggregations, ksqlDB must ensure that each node in a deployment
is always guaranteed to process the same subset of aggregation groupings, which
enables each ksqlDB node to accumulate aggregate results independently of other
nodes in the deployment.

For joins, both sides of the join [must be partitioned](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/joins/partition-data/)
using the same key, known as [co-partitioning](/developer-guide/joins/join-streams-and-tables/#co-partitioned-data),
to guarantee that events for both sides of the join are always processed by the
same ksqlDB node.

ksqlDB re-partitions input topics automatically if they aren't partitioned in a
way that satisfies these partitioning requirements for aggregations and joins.

Whenever ksqlDB repartitions a topic, it creates an internal topic to store the
repartitioned data. These internal topics essentially duplicate their input
topics using the required partitioning key.

Avoiding this data duplication can reduce the amount of topic storage consumed
by your {{ site.ak }} cluster. Also, it can reduce the volume of network round
trips between ksqlDB and {{ site.ak }}.

### Key your streams and tables for your workload

Key your streams and tables explicitly to fit your workload. You may specify
partitioning keys by using the [KEY](/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/create-stream/#synopsis)
column qualifier or a [PARTITION BY](/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/quick-reference/#partition-by)
clause for persistent queries.

### Key your join inputs on columns used downstream

Whenever possible, key your join input streams and tables on the columns that
will be used in downstream joins. If input streams and tables are co-partitioned
already, no internal repartitioning is required to join them.

### Key your aggregation inputs on the grouping criteria

Whenever possible, key your aggregation inputs on the aggregation grouping
criteria. If you're aggregating a stream using a single grouping column,
consider keying the input stream on that column, if your workload permits.
This avoids an internal repartitioning.

When aggregating using multiple grouping columns, ksqlDB generates a composite
key derived from each grouping column, so repartitioning is more difficult to
avoid.

### Avoid unnecessary repartitioning

If repartitioning is unavoidable for some aspect of your workload, consider
sharing any repartitioned data in order to avoid extraneous repartitions. For
example, if you know that you'll be aggregating a stream over column ``col1``
and also joining against ``col1`` somewhere else, keying the stream explicitly
on ``col1`` will avoid two repartitions. This is another instance in which
consolidating logic into as few persistent queries as possible can benefit your
workload's efficiency, by reducing repartitioning overhead.

## Parallelization

To provide scalability and fault tolerance,
[ksqlDB parallelizes workloads](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-safely-scales-with-ksqldb/)
across nodes in a deployment. This parallelism is achieved by leveraging
topic partitions. For a given persistent query, each node in a ksqlDB
deployment processes a subset of the persistent query's input partitions.
This is an important consideration to take into account when designing a
workload that leverages all of the available resources within a ksqlDB
deployment.

### Use an appropriate number of partitions

Spread your workload across your ksqlDB deployment by using an appropriate
number of partitions. If a persistent query's input stream has two partitions,
and your ksqlDB deployment has four nodes, two of these nodes aren't performing
any work for the persistent query, and you get an unbalanced workload. For this
reason, input streams and tables usually should have more partitions than there
are nodes in a ksqlDB deployment. 

Stateful persistent queries create one state store per partition, so too many
partitions can result in an excessive number of state stores, each with a very
thin shard. You need adequate partitions to parallelize your workload completely
across all nodes in your cluster, but no more than that. Usually, a good balance
is achieved with twice as many partitions as nodes in your cluster.

!!! important

    A given node in a ksqlDB deployment can handle more than one input
    partition, so partition counts don't need to be the same as the node count.

## Aggregations

ksqlDB provides one of the easiest ways to [compute aggregations](/developer-guide/syntax-reference/#aggregation)
over your topic data stored in {{ site.ak }}. These aggregations are defined as persistent
queries whose results are maintained within a
[ksqlDB table](/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/create-table-as-select/),
optionally with a
[time window](/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries/#windows-in-sql-queries)
as a dimension. Since aggregations are inherently stateful, they
rely heavily on local materialized [state stores](#state-stores) to accumulate
ongoing aggregation results efficiently. These state stores maintain a local
cache of current aggregate results for the subset of persistent query partitions
that are assigned to a given node in a deployment.

### Consolidate aggregation calls into as few persistent queries as possible

Frequently, aggregations aren't done in isolation, for example, a SUM call is 
often accompanied by a COUNT call. Whenever the aggregation grouping criteria, 
and, potentially, filtering criteria, are equivalent for multiple aggregations,
you should combine these aggregate calls into the same persistent query.
Aggregation consolidation can potentially avoid duplicate repartitioning in
cases for which repartitioning is necessary, as well as minimize the number of
state stores required for a given set of aggregations.

### Avoid unnecessarily narrow window widths

Aggregations that use a [WINDOW](/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries/#windows-in-sql-queries)
clause add dimensionality to the aggregation's grouping criteria. Think of the
aggregation's WINDOW as an implicit grouping column. Each aggregation group
requires local materialization, via state stores, of up to one row per grouping
criteria, per window. For example, a window width of one hour will result in 24
times more windows than a window width of one day. As a result, the number of
locally materialized rows required for a windowed aggregation is inversely
proportional to the window's width. We recommend using aggregation windows with
the widest width that your use case will allow.

## Joins

ksqlDB provides rich support for [joining together multiple streams and tables](/developer-guide/joins/join-streams-and-tables/).
While such join operations are relatively easy to express via SQL, in certain
cases they can become expensive to execute internally.

### Avoid unnecessarily wide join windows

Stream-stream joins require that you specify a [window](/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries/#windowed-joins)
over which to perform the join. Events on each side of the join match only if
they both occur within the specified window. The amount of local state required
for a stream-stream join is directly proportional to the width of the join
window. As a result, we recommend using stream-stream join window widths that
are no wider than your use case permits.

### Ensure both sides of a join are co-partitioned whenever possible

ksqlDB requires that both sides of a join operation are partitioned identically
in order to guarantee that matching events are always processed by the same
ksqlDB node. Whenever two input streams or tables are not co-partitioned,
ksqlDB must perform an internal repartition, thereby duplicating topic data as
well as network round trips issued by the persistent query that does the join.
