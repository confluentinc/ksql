KSQL Operations
===============

================================================
Local Development and Testing with Confluent CLI
================================================

For development and testing purposes, you can use Confluent CLI to spin up services on a single host. For more information,
see the :ref:`quickstart`.

.. include:: ../../includes/cli.rst
    :start-line: 2
    :end-line: 5

===================================
Starting and Stopping KSQL Clusters
===================================

KSQL provides start and stop scripts.

ksql-server-start
    This script starts the KSQL server. It requires a server configuration file as an argument and is located in the ``/bin`` directory
    of your |cp| installation. For more information, see :ref:`install_ksql-server`.

ksql-server-stop
    This script stops the KSQL server. It is located in the ``/bin`` directory of your |cp| installation.

============
Healthchecks
============

- The KSQL REST API supports a "server info" request at `http://<server>:8088/info <http://<server>:8088/info>`_.
- Check runtime stats for the KSQL server that you are connected to via ``DESCRIBE EXTENDED <stream or table>`` and
  ``EXPLAIN <name of query>``.
- Run ``ksql-print-metrics`` on a KSQL server. For example, see this `blog post <https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksql-january-release-streaming-sql-apache-kafka/>`_.


======================
Monitoring and Metrics
======================

KSQL includes JMX (Java Management Extensions) metrics which give insights into what is happening inside your KSQL servers.
These metrics include the number of messages, the total throughput, throughput distribution, error rate, and more.

.. include:: includes/ksql-includes.rst
    :start-line: 320
    :end-line: 327

The ``ksql-print-metrics`` command line utility collects these metrics and prints them to the console. You can invoke this
utility from your terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ <path-to-confluent>/bin/ksql-print-metrics

Your output should resemble:

.. code:: bash

    messages-consumed-avg: 96416.96196183885
    messages-consumed-min: 88900.3329377909
    error-rate: 0.0
    num-persistent-queries: 2.0
    messages-consumed-per-sec: 193024.78294586178
    messages-produced-per-sec: 193025.4730374501
    num-active-queries: 2.0
    num-idle-queries: 0.0
    messages-consumed-max: 103397.81191436431

===============
Troubleshooting
===============

------------------------------------
SELECT query hangs and doesn’t stop?
------------------------------------
Queries in KSQL, including non-persistent queries such as ``SELECT * FROM myTable``, are continuous streaming queries.
Streaming queries  will not stop unless explicitly terminated.  To terminate a non-persistent query in the KSQL CLI you
must type ``Ctrl + C``.

--------------------------------------------------
No results from ``SELECT * FROM`` table or stream?
--------------------------------------------------
This is typically caused by the query being configured to process only newly arriving data instead, and no new input records are being received. To fix, do one of the following:

- Run this command: ``SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';``. For more information, see :ref:`install_cli-config` and
  :ref:`ksql-server-config`.
- Write new records to the input topics.

------------------------------------------------------------
Can’t create a stream from the output of windowed aggregate?
------------------------------------------------------------
The output of a windowed aggregate is a record per grouping key and per window, and is not a single record. This is not
currently supported in KSQL.

------------------------------------------
KSQL doesn’t clean up its internal topics?
------------------------------------------
Make sure that your Kafka cluster is configured with ``delete.topic.enable=true``. For more information, see :cp-javadoc:`deleteTopics|clients/javadocs/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClient.html`.
