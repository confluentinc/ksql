# Metrics

ksqlDB emits a variety of JMX metrics to help you understand
[monitor](../operate-and-deploy/monitoring.md) what its servers are
doing. This reference describes each metric and grouping.

## All persistent queries

Metrics that describe the full set of persistent queries on a given server.

```
io.confluent.ksql.metrics:type=_confluent-ksql-engine-query-stats,ksql_service_id=<ksql.service.id>
```

### Attributes

**Number of persistent queries**

`num-persistent-queries`

The current number of persistent queries running in this engine.

**Number of active queries**

`num-active-queries`

The current number of active queries running in this engine.

**Number of running queries**

`RUNNING-queries`

Count of queries in `RUNNING` state.

**Number of idle queries**

`num-idle-queries`

Number of inactive queries.

**Number of not running queries**

`NOT_RUNNING-queries`

Count of queries in `NOT_RUNNING` state.

**Number of rebalancing queries**

`REBALANCING-queries`

Count of queries in `REBALANCING` state.

**Number of created queries**

`CREATED-queries`

Count of queries in `CREATED` state.

**Number of pending shutdown queries**

`PENDING_SHUTDOWN-queries`

Count of queries in `PENDING_SHUTDOWN` state.

**Number of error queries**

`ERROR-queries`

Count of queries in `ERROR` state.

**Total bytes consumed**

`bytes-consumed-total`

The total number of bytes consumed across all queries.

**Minimum messages consumed**

`messages-consumed-min`

Min msgs consumed by query.

**Maximum messages consumed**

`messages-consumed-max`

Max msgs consumed by query.

**Average messages consumed**

`messages-consumed-avg`

Mean msgs consumed by query.

**Messages consumed per second**

`messages-consumed-per-sec`

The number of messages consumed per second across all queries.

**Messages consumed total**

`messages-consumed-total`

The total number of messages consumed across all queries.

**Messages produced per second**

`messages-produced-per-sec`

The number of messages produced per second across all queries.

**Error rate**

`error-rate`

The number of messages that were consumed but not processed. Messages may not be processed if, for instance, the message contents could not be deserialized due to an incompatible schema. Alternately, a consumed message may not have been produced, hence being effectively dropped. Such messages would also be counted toward the error rate.

**Liveness indicator**

`liveness-indicator`

A metric with constant value `1` indicating the server is up and emitting metrics.

## Persistent query status

Metrics that describe the health of each persistent query.

```
io.confluent.ksql.metrics:type=ksql-queries
```

### Attributes

**Query status**

`query-status`

The current status of the given query.

**Error status**

`error-status`

The current error status of the given query, if the state is in ERROR state.

## Persistent query production

Metrics that describe the producer activity of each persistent query.

```
io.confluent.ksql.metrics:type=producer-metrics
```

### Attributes

**Total messages**

`total-messages`

The total number of messages produced.

**Messages per second**

`messages-per-sec`

The total number of messages produced per second.

## Persistent query consumption

Metrics that describe the consumer activity of each persistent query.

```
io.confluent.ksql.metrics:type=consumer-metrics
```

### Attributes

**Total messages**

`consumer-total-messages`

The total number of messages consumed.

**Messages per second**

`consumer-messages-per-sec`

The total number of messages consumed per second.

**Total bytes**

`consumer-total-bytes`

The total number of bytes consumed.

## Runtime

Because ksqlDB persistent queries directly compile into {{
site.kstreams }} topologies, many useful [{{ site.kstreams }}
metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/monitoring.html)
are emitted for each persistent query. These metrics are omitted from
this reference to avoid redundancy.

## HTTP server

ksqlDB's REST API is built ontop of Vert, and consequentially exposes
many [Vert.x
metrics](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-dropwizard-metrics/java/)
directly. These metrics are omitted from this reference to avoid redundancy.


## Pull queries

Metrics that describe the activity of pull queries on each server.

```
io.confluent.ksql.metrics:type=_confluent-ksql-default_pull-query
```

!!! info
    Pull query metrics must be enabled explicitly by setting
    the `ksql.query.pull.metrics.enabled` server configuration to `true`.

### Attributes

**Pull query total requests**

`pull-query-requests-total`

Total number of pull query requests.

**Pull query request rate**

`pull-query-requests-rate`

Rate of pull query requests per second.

**Pull query requests error count**

`pull-query-requests-error-total`

Total number of erroneous pull query requests.

**Pull query request error rate**

`pull-query-requests-error-rate`

Rate of erroneous pull query requests per second.

**Local pull query requests count**

`pull-query-requests-local`

Count of local pull query requests.

**Local pull query requests rate**

`pull-query-requests-local-rate`

Rate of local pull query requests per second.

**Remote pull query requests count**

`pull-query-requests-remote`

Count of remote pull query requests.

**Remote pull query requests rate**

`pull-query-requests-remote-rate`

Rate of remote pull query requests per second.

**Pull query minimum request latency**

`pull-query-requests-latency-latency-min`

Average time for a pull query request.

**Pull query maximum request latency**

`pull-query-requests-latency-latency-max`

Max time for a pull query request.

**Pull query average request latency**

`pull-query-requests-latency-latency-avg`

Average time for a pull query request.

**Pull query latency 50th percentile**

`pull-query-requests-latency-distribution-50`

Latency distribution of the 50th percentile.

**Pull query latency 75th percentile**

`pull-query-requests-latency-distribution-75`

Latency distribution of the 75th percentile.

**Pull query latency 75th percentile**

`pull-query-requests-latency-distribution-90`

Latency distribution of the 90th percentile.

**Pull query latency 99th percentile**

`pull-query-requests-latency-distribution-99`

Latency distribution of the 99th percentile.

## User-defined functions

Metrics that describe the activity of user-defined functions, both in-built and custom added.

```
io.confluent.ksql.metrics:type=ksql-udf
```

!!! info
    UDF metrics must be enabled explicitly by setting
    the `ksql.udf.collect.metrics` server configuration to `true`.

### Attributes

ksqlDB creates a series of attributes per user-defined function.
The general form is:

```
ksql-(udf | udtf | udaf)-<function name>-(avg | count | max | rate)
```

For example, if you had a UDF named formula, you would see these attributes:

- `ksql-udf-formula-avg`
- `ksql-udf-formula-count`
- `ksql-udf-formula-max`
- `ksql-udf-formula-rate`

Here are what each of these suffixes mean.

**avg**

Average time for an invocation of the function.

**count**

Total number of invocations of the function.

**max**

Max time for an invocation of the function.

**rate**

The average number of invocations per second of the function.

## Command runner

Metrics that describe the health of the `CommandRunner` thread, which
enables each node to participate in distributed computation.

```
io.confluent.ksql.metrics:type=_confluent-ksql-rest-app-command-runner
```

### Attributes

**Thread status**

`status`

The status of the commandRunner thread as it processes the command topic.
