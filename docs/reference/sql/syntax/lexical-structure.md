SQL is a domain-specific language for managing and manipulating data. It’s
used primarily to work with structured data, where the types and relationships
across entities are well-defined. Originally adopted for relational databases,
SQL is rapidly becoming the language of choice for stream processing. It’s
declarative, expressive, and ubiquitous.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) maintains a standard for the
specification of SQL. SQL-92, the third revision to the standard, is generally
the most recognized form of the specification. Beyond the standard, there are
many flavors and extensions to SQL so that it can express programs beyond
what's possible with the SQL-92 grammar.

ksqlDB’s SQL grammar was built  initially around Presto's grammar and has been
extended judiciously. ksqlDB goes beyond SQL-92, because the standard currently
has no constructs for streaming queries, which are a core aspect of this project.

## Syntax

SQL inputs are made up of a series of statements. Each statements is made up of
a series of tokens and ends in a semicolon (`;`). The tokens that apply depend
on the statement being invoked.

A token is any keyword, identifier, backticked identifier, literal, or special
character. By convention, tokens are separated by whitespace, unless there is
no ambiguity in the grammar. This happens when tokens flank a special character.

The following example statements are syntactically valid ksqlDB SQL input:

```sql
INSERT INTO s1 (a, b) VALUES ('k1', 'v1');

CREATE STREAM s2 AS
    SELECT a, b
    FROM s1
    EMIT CHANGES;

SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE k1='foo' EMIT CHANGES;
```

## Keywords

Some tokens, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `CREATE`, are _keywords_.
Keywords are reserved tokens that have a specific meaning in ksqlDB's syntax.
They control their surrounding allowable tokens and execution semantics.
Keywords are case insensitive, meaning `SELECT` and `select` are equivalent.
You can't create an identifier that is already a keyword, unless you use
backticked identifiers.

A complete list of keywords can be found in the [appendix](../appendix.md#keywords).

## Identifiers

Identifiers are symbols that represent user-space entities, like streams,
tables, columns, and other objects. For example, if you have a stream named
`s1`, `s1` is an _identifier_ for that stream. By default, identifiers are
case-insensitive, meaning `s1` and `S1` refer to the same stream. Under the
hood, ksqlDB capitalizes all of the characters in the identifier for all
future display purposes.

Unless an identifier is backticked, it may be composed only of characters that
are a letter, number, or underscore. There is no imposed limit on the number of
characters.

To make it possible to use any character in an identifier, you can enclose it
in backticks (``` ` ```) when you declare and use it. A _backticked identifier_
is useful when you don't control the data, so it might have special characters,
or even keywords. When you use backticked identifers, ksqlDB  captures the case 
exactly, and any future references to the identifer become case-sensitive. For
example, if you declare the following stream:

```sql
CREATE STREAM `s1` (
    k VARCHAR KEY,
    `@MY-identifier-stream-column!` INT
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 's1',
    partitions = 3,
    value_format = 'json'
);
```

You must select from it by backticking the stream name and column name and
using the original casing:

```sql
SELECT `@MY-identifier-stream-column!` FROM `s3` EMIT CHANGES;
```

## Constants

There are three implicitly typed constants, or literals, in ksqlDB: strings,
numbers, and booleans.

### String constants

A string constant is an arbitrary series of characters surrounded by single
quotes (`'`), like `'Hello world'`. To include a quote inside of a string
literal, escape the quote by prefixing it with another quote, for example
`'You can call me ''Stuart'', or Stu.'`

### Numeric constants

Numeric constants are accepted in the following forms:

1. **_`digits`_**
2. **_`digits`_**`.[`**_`digits`_**`][e[+-]`**_`digits`_**`]`
3. `[`**_`digits`_**`].`**_`digits`_**`[e[+-]`**_`digits`_**`]`
4. **_`digits`_**`e[+-]`**_`digits`_**

where **_`digits`_** is one or more single-digit integers (`0` through `9`).

- At least one digit must be present before or after the decimal point, if
  there is one.
- At least one digit must follow the exponent symbol `e`, if there is one.
- Spaces and underscores (nor any other characters) are allowed in the constant.
- Numeric constants may also have a `+` or `-` prefix, but this considered to
  be a function applied to the constant, not the constant itself.

Here are some examples of valid numeric constants:

- `5`
- `7.2`
- `0.0087`
- `1.`
- `.5`
- `1e-3`
- `1.332434e+2`
- `+100`
- `-250`

### Boolean constants

A boolean constant is represented as either the identifer `true` or `false`.
Boolean constants are not case-sensitive, meaning `true` evaluates to the same
value as `TRUE`.

## Operators

Operators are infix functions composed of special characters. A complete list
of operators can be found in the [appendix](../appendix.md#operators). ksqlDB
doesn't allow you to add user-space operators.

## Special characters

Some characters have a particular meaning that doesn't correspond to an
operator. The following list describes the special characters and their
purpose.

- Parentheses (`()`) retain their usual meaning in programming languages for
  grouping expressions and controlling the order of evaluation.
- Brackets (`[]`) are used to work with arrays, both in their construction and
  subscript access.
- Commas (`,`) delineate a discrete list of entities.
- The semi-colons (`;`) terminates a SQL command.
- The asterisk (`*`), when used in particular syntax, is used as an "all"
  qualifier. This is seen most commonly in a `SELECT` command to retrieve all
  columns.
- The period (`.`) accesses a column in a stream or table.
- The arrow (`->`) accesses a field in a struct data type.

## Comments

A comment is a string beginning with twos dashes. It includes all of the
content from the dashes to the end of the line:

```sql
-- Here is a comment.
```

You can also span a comment over multiple lines by using C-style syntax:

```sql
/* Here is
   another comment.
 */
```

## Lexical precedence

Operators are evaluated using the following order of precedence:

1. `*`, `/`, `%`
2. `+`, `-`
3. `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`, `!=`
4. `NOT`
5. `AND`
6. `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `OR`

In an expression, when two operators have the same precedence level, they're
evaluated left-to-right based on their position.

You can enclose an expression in parentheses to force precedence or clarify
precedence, for example, `(5 + 2) * 3`.
