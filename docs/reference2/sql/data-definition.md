This section covers how you create the structures that store your events. ksqlDB abstracts events as rows with columns and stores them in streams and tables.

## Rows and columns

Streams and tables help you model collections of events that accrete over time. Both are represented as a series of rows and columns with a schema, much like a relational database table. Rows represent individual events. Columns represent the attributes of those events.

Each column has a data type. The data type limits the span of permissible values that it can take on. For example, if a column is declared as type `INT`, it cannot take on the value of string `'foo'`.

In contrast to relational database tables, the columns of a row in ksqlDB are divided into "key" and "value" columns. The key columns control which partition a row resides in. The value columns, by convention, are used to store the main data of interest. Being able to control the key columns is useful for manipulating the underlying data locality, and generally allows you to integrate with the wider Kafka ecosystem, which uses the same key/value data model. By default, a column is a value column. Marking a column as a `(PRIMARY) KEY` makes it a key column.

Internally, each row is backed by a [Kafka record](../../../overview/apache-kafka-primer/#records). In Kafka, the key and value parts of a record are independently [serialized](../../../overview/apache-kafka-primer/#serializers). ksqlDB allows you to exercise that same flexibility, and generally builds on the semantics of Kafka records, rather than hiding them.

There is no theoretical limit on the number of columns in a stream or table. In practice, the limit is determined by the maximum message size that Kafka can store and the resources dedicated to ksqlDB.

## Streams

Streams are partitioned, immutable, append-only collections. They represent a series of historical facts. For example, the rows of a stream could model a sequence of financial transactions, like "Alice sent $100 to Bob”, then “Charlie sent $50 to Bob".

Once a row is inserted into a stream, it can never change. New rows can be appended at the end of the stream, but existing rows can never be updated or deleted.

Each row is stored in a particular partition. Every row, implicitly or explicitly, has a key that represents its identity. All rows with the same key reside in the same partition.

To create a stream, use the `CREATE STREAM` command. In this command, you specify a name for the new stream, the names of the columns, and the data type of each column.

```sql
CREATE STREAM s1 (
    k VARCHAR KEY,
    v1 INT,
    v2 VARCHAR
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 's1',
    partitions = 3,
    value_format = 'json'
);
```

This creates a new stream named `s1` with three columns: `k`, `v1`, and `v2`. The column `k` is designated as the key of this stream, which controls which partition each row is stored in. When the data is stored, the value portion of each row's underlying Kafka record will be serialized in the JSON format.

Under the covers, each stream corresponds to a [Kafka topic](../../../overview/apache-kafka-primer/#topics) with a registered schema. If the backing topic for a stream doesn't exist when you declare it, ksqlDB creates it on your behalf, as in the example above.

You can also declare a stream on top of an existing topic. When you do that, ksqlDB simply registers its associated schema. If topic `s2` already exists, this command will register a new stream over it:

```sql
CREATE STREAM s2 (
    k1 VARCHAR KEY,
    v1 VARCHAR
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 's2',
    value_format = 'json'
);
```

Note that when you create a stream on an existing topic, you don't need to declare the number of partitions in it. ksqlDB simply infers the partition count from the existing topic.

## Tables

Tables are mutable, partitioned collections that model change over time. By contrast to streams, which represent a historical sequence of events, tables represent what is true as of "now". For example, you might use a table to model the locations that someone has lived at as a stream: first Miami, then New York, then London, and so forth.

Tables work by leveraging the keys of each row. If a sequence of rows shares a key, the last row for a given key represents the most up-to-date information for that key's identity. A background process periodically runs and deletes all but the newest rows for each key.

Here is what declaring a table looks like in code. Syntactically, it is almost the same as declaring a stream.

```sql
CREATE TABLE current_location (
    person VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    location VARCHAR
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 'current_location',
    partitions = 3,
    value_format = 'json'
);
```

As with streams, tables can also be declared directly ontop of an existing Kafka topic. Simply omit the number of partitions in the `WITH` clause.

## Keys

Columns can be marked with the `KEY` keyword to indicate that they are key columns. Key columns constitute the key portion of the row's underlying Kafka record. Only streams can mark columns as keys, and it is optional for them to do do. Tables must use the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint instead.

In this example, `k1`'s data is stored in the key portion of the row, while `v1`'s data is stored in the value.

```sql
CREATE STREAM s3 (
    k1 VARCHAR KEY,
    v1 VARCHAR
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 's3',
    value_format = 'json'
);
```

Being able to explicitly declare key columns is especially useful when you are creating a stream over an existing topic. If ksqlDB cannot infer what data is in the key of the underlying Kafka record, it must internally perform a repartition of the rows. If you're not sure what data is in the key or you simply don't need it, you can omit the `KEY` keyword.

## Default values

If a column is declared in a schema, but no attribute is present in the underlying Kafka record, the value for the row's column is populated as `null`.

## Pseudocolumns

Pseudocolumns are columns that are automatically populated by ksqlDB. They contain meta-information that can be infered about the row at creation time. By default, pseudocolumns are not returned when selecting all columns with the star (`*`) special character. You must select them explicitly, as in:

```sql
SELECT ROWTIME, * FROM s1 EMIT CHANGES;
```

The following table lists all pseudocolumns.

| pseudocolumn | meaning                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| `ROWTIME`    | Row timestamp, inferred from the underlying Kafka record if not overridden. |

You cannot create additional pseudocolumns beyond these.

## Constraints

Although data types help limit the range of values that can be accepted by ksqlDB, sometimes it is useful to have more sophisticated restrictions. Constraints allow you to exercise that type of logic directly in your schema.

### Primary key constraints

In a relational database, a primary key indicates that a column will be used as a unique identifier for all rows in a table. If you have a table with a row in it who's primary key is `5`, you can't insert another row whose primary key is also `5`.

ksqlDB uses primary keys in a similar way, but there are a few differences because it is an event streaming database, not a relational database.

First, only tables can have primary keys. Streams do not support them. Second, adding multiple rows to a table with the same primary key doesn't cause the subsequent rows to be rejected. The reason for both of these behaviors is the same: the purpose of tables are to model change of particular identities, whereas streams are used to accrete facts. When you insert multiple rows to a table with the same primary key, ksqlDB inteprets those rows as changes to a single identity.

Primary keys cannot be null, and they must be used in all declared tables. In this example, `id` acts as the primary key for table `users`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY
    name VARCHAR
  ) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 'users',
    partitions = 3,
    value_format = 'json'
  );
```

### Not-null constraints

A not-null constraint designates that a column cannot contain a null value. ksqlDB doesn't yet support this constraint, but you can track the progress towards it in [GitHub issue 4436](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/4436).
