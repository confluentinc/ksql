The KSQL CLI provides a terminal-based interactive shell for running queries. The CLI is a self-executing JAR file, which means it acts like a normal UNIX executable.

# CLI-specific commands
These commands are non-KSQL statements such as setting a property or adding a resource. Run the CLI with the --help option to see the available options.

```bash
Description:
  The KSQL CLI provides a terminal-based interactive shell for running queries. Each command must be on a separate line. For KSQL command syntax, see the documentation at https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/docs/.

help:
  Show this message.

clear:
  Clear the current terminal.

output:
  View the current output format.

output <format>:
  Set the output format to <format> (valid formats: 'JSON', 'TABULAR')
  For example: "output JSON"

history:
  Show previous lines entered during the current CLI session. You can use up and down arrow keys to navigate to the previous lines too.

version:
  Get the current KSQL version.

exit:
  Exit the CLI.


Default behavior:

    Lines are read one at a time and are sent to the server as KSQL unless one of the following is true:

    1. The line is empty or entirely whitespace. In this case, no request is made to the server.

    2. The line ends with backslash ('\'). In this case, lines are continuously read and stripped of their trailing newline and '\' until one is encountered that does not end with '\'; then, the concatenation of all lines read during this time is sent to the server as KSQL.
```

# KSQL commands
KSQL statements should be terminated with a semicolon (`;`). If desired, use a back-slash ('\\') to indicate continuation on the next line. 

## DDL statements

The supported DDL statements are described here.

### DESCRIBE stream-or-table
List the columns in a stream or table along with their data type and other attributes.

### SHOW | LIST TOPICS
List the topics in schema or in the current schema.

### SHOW | LIST STREAMS
List the streams in schema or in the current schema.

### SHOW | LIST TABLES
List the tables in schema or in the current schema.

### SHOW QUERIES
List the queries in schema or in the current schema.

### TERMINATE `query-id`
End a query. Queries will run continuously as Kafka Streams applications until they are explicitly terminated. 

### CREATE STREAM stream_name (  { column_name data_type} [, ...] ) WITH ( property_name = expression [, ...] );
Create a new empty Kafka stream with the specified columns and properties.

The supported column data types are BOOELAN(BOOL), INTEGER(INT), BIGINT(LONG), DOUBLE, VARCHAR (STRING), ARRAY<ArrayType> (JSON only) and MAP<VARCHAR, ValueType> (JSON only).

In addition to the defined columns in the statement, KSQL adds two implicit columns to every stream, ROWKEY and ROWTIME, which represent the corresponding Kafka message key and message timestamp.

The possible properties to set in the WITH clause:
* KAFKA_TOPIC: The name of the Kafka topic that this streams is built upon. The topic should already exist in Kafka. This is a required property.
* VALUE_FORMAT: Specifies the format in which the value in the topic that data is serialized in. Currently, KSQL supports JSON, delimited. This is a required property.
* KEY: The name of the column that is the key.
* TIMESTAMP: The name of the column that will be used as the timestamp. This can be used to define the event time.

Example

```
ksql> CREATE STREAM pageview (viewtime bigint, userid varchar, pageid varchar) WITH (value_format = 'json', kafka_topic='pageview_topic_json');
```

### CREATE TABLE table_name (  { column_name data_type} [, ...] ) WITH ( property_name = expression [, ...] );
Create a new KSQL table with the specified columns and properties. The supported column data types are BOOELAN(BOOL), INTEGER(INT), BIGINT(LONG), DOUBLE, VARCHAR (STRING), ARRAY<ArrayType> (JSON only) and MAP<VARCHAR, ValueType> (JSON only).

In addition to the defined columns in the statement, KSQL adds two implicit columns to every table, ROWKEY and ROWTIME, which represent the corresponding Kafka message key and message timestamp.

The possible properties to set in the WITH clause:
* KAFKA_TOPIC: The name of the Kafka topic that this streams is built upon. The topic should already exist in Kafka. This is a required property.
* VALUE_FORMAT: Specifies the format in which the value in the topic that data is serialized in. Currently, KSQL supports JSON, delimited. This is a required property.
* TIMESTAMP: The name of the column that will be used as the timestamp.

Example

```
ksql> CREATE TABLE users (usertimestamp bigint, userid varchar, gender varchar, regionid varchar) WITH (value_format = 'json', kafka_topic='user_topic_json'); 
```

## DML statements

### SELECT
Selects rows from a KSQL stream or table. The result of this statement will be printed out in the console. To stop the continuous query in the CLI press Ctrl+C.

```
SELECT `select_expr` [, ...] 
FROM `from_item` [, ...]
[ WINDOW `window_expression` ]
[ WHERE `condition` ]
[ GROUP BY `grouping expression` ]
[ HAVING `having_expression` ]
```

where `from_item` is one of the following:

- `table_name [ [ AS ] alias]`

- `from_item LEFT JOIN from_item ON join_condition`

The WINDOW clause is used to define a window for aggregate queries. KSQL supports the following WINDOW types:

* TUMBLING 
  The TUMBLING window requires a size parameter.

  Example

  ```
  ksql> SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orderunits > 5 ;
  ```

* HOPPING
  The HOPPING window is a fixed sized, (possibly) overlapping window. You must provide two values for a HOPPING window, size and advance interval. The following is an example query with hopping window.

  Example

  ```
  ksql> SELECT ITEMID, SUM(arraycol[0]) FROM ORDERS window HOPPING ( size 20 second, advance by 5 second) GROUP BY ITEMID;
  ```

* SESSION
  SESSION windows are used to aggregate key-based events into so-called sessions. The SESSION window requires the session inactivity gap size. 

  Example

  ```
  ksql> SELECT ITEMID, SUM(arraycol[0]) FROM ORDERS window SESSION (20 second) GROUP BY ITEMID;
  ```

### CREATE STREAM AS SELECT
Create a new KSQL stream along with the corresponding Kafka topic and stream the result of the SELECT query into the topic.  

```
CREATE STREAM `stream_name`
[WITH ( `property_name = expression` [, ...] )] 
AS SELECT  `select_expr` [, ...] 
FROM `from_item` [, ...] 
[ WHERE `condition` ] 
[PARTITION BY `column_name`]
```  
 
You can use the WITH section to set the properties for the result KSQL topic. The properties that can be set are:

* KAFKA_TOPIC: The name of KSQL topic and the corresponding Kafka topic associated with the new KSQL stream. If not specified, the name of the stream will be used as default.

* FORMAT: Specifies the format in which the result topic data is serialized in. KSQL supports JSON, Avro and CSV. If not set the same format of the input stream will be used.

* AVROSCHEMAFILE: The path to write the Avro schema file for the result. If the output format is Avro, avroschemafile will be set. If not set the generated schema file will be written to "/tmp/" folder with the name of the stream as the file name.

* PARTITIONS: The number of partitions in the sink stream.

* REPLICATIONS: The replication factor for the sink stream.

* TIMESTAMP: The name of the column that will be used as the timestamp. This can be used to define the event time.

### CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
Create a new KSQL table along with the corresponding KSQL topic and Kafka topic and stream the result of the SELECT query into the topic.  

```
CREATE TABLE `stream_name` 
[WITH ( `property_name = expression` [, ...] )] 
AS SELECT  `select_expr` [, ...] 
FROM `from_item` [, ...] 
[ WHERE `condition` ]
[ GROUP BY `grouping expression` ] 
[ HAVING `having_expression` ]
```

The WITH section can be used to set the properties for the result KSQL topic. The properties that can be set are as the following:

* KAFKA_TOPIC: The name of KSQL topic and the corresponding Kafka topic associated with the new KSQL stream. If not set, the name of the stream will be used as default.

* FORMAT: Specifies the format in which the result topic data is serialized in. KSQL supports JSON, Avro and CSV. If not set, the same format of the input stream will be used.

* AVROSCHEMAFILE: The path to write the Avro schema file for the result. If the output format is Avro, avroschemafile will be set. If not set the generated schema file will be written to `/tmp/` folder with the name of the stream as the file name.

* PARTITIONS: The number of partitions in the sink stream.

* REPLICATIONS: The replication factor for the sink stream.
