KSQL Testing Tool
###########################

Use the KSQL testing tool to test a set of KSQL statements. The KSQL testing tool
is a command line utility that enables testing KSQL statements without requiring any infrastructure, like |ak-tm| and KSQL clusters.
The KSQL testing tool is a great way to design your KSQL pipeline and ensure the expected results are generated.
You can collaborate on designing your KSQL statements by sharing the test files.
To test a set of KSQL statements, you provide three files, one file containing the KSQL statements and two JSON files containing the input records and the expected output records.

.. code:: bash

    NAME
            ksql-test-runner - The KSQL testing tool

    SYNOPSIS
            ksql-test-runner {--input-file | -i} <inputFile>
                    {--output-file | -o} <outputFile>
                    {--sql-file | -s} <statementsFile>

    OPTIONS
            --input-file <inputFile>, -i <inputFile>
                A JSON file containing the input records.

                This option may occur a maximum of 1 time


            --output-file <outputFile>, -o <outputFile>
                A JSON file containing the expected output records.

                This option may occur a maximum of 1 time


            --sql-file <statementsFile>, -s <statementsFile>
                A SQL file containing KSQL statements to be tested.

                This option may occur a maximum of 1 time



Test File Structure
*******************

Statements File
---------------

The statements file contains the KSQL statements to test. The following are the supported statements in the testing tool:

- CREATE STREAM
- CREATE TABLE
- CREATE STREAM AS SELECT
- CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
- INSERT INTO SELECT

Here is a sample statements file for the testing tool:

.. code:: sql
    CREATE STREAM SRTREAM1 (ID bigint, NAME varchar, VALUE double) WITH (kafka_topic='test_topic', value_format='DELIMITED', key='ID');
    CREATE STREAM SRTREAM2 as SELECT name FROM SRTREAM1 WHERE id > 100;

Input File
----------

The input file is a JSON file with one array field named "inputs". Each element in the array is the representation of input messages.
A message should have a topic, a key, a value and a timestamp. The following is a sample input file for the above test:

.. code:: json
    {
      "inputs": [
        {"topic": "test_topic", "key": 0, "value": "0,zero,0.0"},
        {"topic": "test_topic", "key": 100, "value": "100,100,0.0"},
        {"topic": "test_topic", "key": 101, "value": "101,101,0.0"}
      ]
    }


Output File
----------

The output file is a JSON file with an array field named "outputs". Similar to the input file, each element in the array is the representation of the expected output messages.
An expected output message should have a topic, a key, a value and a timestamp. The following is a sample expected output file for the above test:

.. code:: json
     {
       "outputs": [
               {"topic": "SRTREAM1", "key": 101, "value": "101"}
       ]
     }


In the output output files you can have messages with windowed keys. Such messages can be generated by windowed aggretations in KSQL.
To specify a window for a message you can add a "window" field to the message. A window field has three fields:

- start: the start time for the window.
- end: the end time for the window.
- type: the type of the window. A window type can be ``time`` or ``session``.

The following is an example expected output file with records that have a window field:

.. code:: json
     {
        "outputs": [
          {"topic": "S2", "key": 0, "value": "0,0", "timestamp": 0, "window": {"start": 0, "end": 30000, "type": "time"}},
          {"topic": "S2", "key": 0, "value": "0,5", "timestamp": 10000, "window": {"start": 0, "end": 30000, "type": "time"}},
          {"topic": "S2", "key": 100, "value": "100,100", "timestamp": 30000, "window": {"start": 30000, "end": 60000, "type": "time"}},
          {"topic": "S2", "key": 100, "value": "100,100", "timestamp": 45000, "window": {"start": 30000, "end": 60000, "type": "time"}}
        ]
     }

Currently, in the input files you can only have record with session window types.

The testing tool will indicate the success or failure of a test by printing the corresponding message. The following is the result of a successful test:

.. code:: bash
    ksql-test-runner -s statements.sql -i input.json -o output.json
     Test passed!

If a test fails, the testing tool will indicate the failure along with the cause. Here is an example of the output for a failing test:

.. code:: bash
    ksql-test-runner -s statements.sql -i input.json -o output.json
      Test failed: Expected <900, {T_ID=90, NAME=ninety}> with timestamp=17000 but was <90, {T_ID=90, NAME=ninety}> with timestamp=17000
