# Classes/Packages that aren't allowed to be loaded by UDFs.
# if a class name ends with $ it will only match that class
# otherwise it will match anything beginning with the string.

# For example, the following line would match only the java.lang.Compiler class.
#java.lang.Compiler$

# The following line would match any classes that begin with java.lang.Compiler
#java.lang.Compiler

# The following line would match any classes that are in the java.lang.invoke package
