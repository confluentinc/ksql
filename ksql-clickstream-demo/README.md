# Clickstream Analysis

Clickstream analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting aggregate data about which pages a website visitor visits and in what order. The path the visitor takes though a website is called the clickstream.

This demo focuses on building real-time analytics of users to determine:
* General website analytics, such as hit count & visitors
* Bandwidth use
* Mapping user-IP addresses to actual users and their location
* Detection of high-bandwidth user sessions
* Error-code occurrence and enrichment
* Sessionization to track user-sessions and understand behavior (such as per-user-session-bandwidth, per-user-session-hits etc)

The demo uses standard streaming functions (i.e., min, max, etc), as well as enrichment using child tables, table-stream joins and different types of windowing functionality.
