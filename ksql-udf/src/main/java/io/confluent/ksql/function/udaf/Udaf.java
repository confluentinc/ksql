 *   <li>{@code initialize()}: to get the initial value for the aggregate</li>
 *   <li>{@code aggregate(value, aggregate)}: adds {@code value} to the {@code aggregate}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code merge(agg1, agg2)}: merges to aggregates together, e.g. on session merges.</li>
 *   <li>{@code map(agg)}: reduces the intermediate state to the final output type.</li>

 * @param <I> the input type
 * @param <A> the intermediate aggregate type
