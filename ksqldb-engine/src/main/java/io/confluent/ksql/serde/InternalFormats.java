   * Build formats for internal topics.
   *
   * <p>Internal topics don't normally need any serde features set, as they use the format
   * defaults.  However, until ksqlDB supports wrapped single keys, any internal topic with a key
   * format that supports both wrapping and unwrapping needs to have an explicit {@link
   * SerdeFeature#UNWRAP_SINGLES} set to ensure backwards compatibility is easily achievable once
   * wrapped keys are supported.
   * 
   * <p>Note: The unwrap feature should only be set when there is only a single key column. As
   * ksql does not yet support multiple key columns, the only time there is no a single key column
   * is when there is no key column, i.e. key-less streams. Internal topics, i.e. changelog and 
   * repartition topics, are never key-less. Hence this method can safely set the unwrap feature
   * without checking the schema.
   *
   * <p>The code that sets the option can be removed once wrapped keys are supported. Issue 6296
   * tracks the removal.
   *
   * @param keyFormat key format.
   * @param valueFormat value format.
   * @return Formats instance.
