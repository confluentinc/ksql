  /**
   * Checks whether or not this execution step can be safely replaced
   * with {@code other} without causing upgrade issues such as corrupted
   * state stores or repartition topics.
   *
   * <p>{@code validateUpgrade} checks compatibility by starting from the
   * parent and then traversing down the execution step tree. This means that
   * at any given point, the implementation can assume that the path above
   * the current node is upgrade compatible.
   *
   * <p>The implementation relies on two different types of nodes:
   *  <ol>
   *    <li><b>Enforcing Steps</b>: these steps are "stopping" points in the validation
   *    tree and will bring the {@code to} tree to match the enforcing step, skipping
   *    any passive steps that show up in between./li>
   *
   *    <li><b>Passive Steps</b>: these are steps that can be added/removed to topologies
   *    without causing any issues to upgrades. They will delegate their upgrade
   *    validation to their corresponding source nodes</li>
   *  </ol>
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>With this implementation strategy, we essentially have two pointers
   * into query plans: the source and the target. We traverse the trees advancing
   * the pointer in the source tree until we hit an enforcing step. The enforcing
   * step will advance the pointer until either the target tree has a matching,
   * valid enforcing step or there is an invalid step in between at which point
   * an exception will be propagated.
   *
   * <p>For example, consider the following two trees:
   * <pre>
   *   source (s): SINK -> SELECT -> SELECT_KEY -> SOURCE
   *   target (t): SINK -> FILTER -> SELECT_KEY -> SOURCE
   * </pre>
   * Within these trees, the {@code SINK}, {@code SELECT_KEY} and {@code SOURCE}
   * nodes are <i>enforcing</i> steps and the others are <i>passive</i> steps. The
   * algorithm would first compare the two SINK steps, then advance {@code s} until
   * the {@code s.SELECT_KEY} step. Since {@code t.FILTER} is passive, it can be skipped,
   * at which point the algorithm would hit another <i>enforcing</i> node ({@code t.SELECT_KEY}).
   * It would then compare those two steps and the two {@code SOURCE} steps to determine
   * whether or not the two trees are compatible. This essentially "reduces" the two trees
   * only to their enforcing nodes and makes sure that those are compatible with one
   * another.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation does not support upgrades, taking an "allowlist"
   * approach instead of a "denylist" approach so that we can guarantee that only
   * query upgrades that we've reasoned about and stamped with an approval will be
   * supported.
